            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>GERY,</hi> RECTOR of <hi>Barwell</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>SIR, as I am rejoyced to ſee the late works of your reverend brother in law my honoured Friend, Doctor <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> So for our mother <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſake, I count it among my felicities to find our Country-man,
<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Hall.</hi>
                     </note> and by much our elder brother in that Arcademy, (a modern right Reverend Father of the Church) ſtill increaſing his voluminous, ſweet and pious writings, and like a true celeſtial plant, bringing forth more fruit in his age; And that comfort is increaſed by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you alſo (though conſtantly employed upon a Cure) ſo enabled to afford the world ſuch a teſtimony as theſe papers preſent of ſolid Theology; amongſt which after my peruſal of the great pains and methodical clearing of that ſubject con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our laſt reſolution of faith divine, into Divine Scripture; and your colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to that end of ſo many and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments, I could not refrain my Pen from gratulating to you this
<pb facs="tcp:170280:3"/>work, ſo highly conducible to the glory of God, in the exaltation of his holy Word; and to the edification of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſouls, who ſhall enjoy the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of being much confirmed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted in their moſt precious faith, by thoſe aſſiſtances in your Book: for the ſpeedy Edition whereof I do not only hereby ſolicite, but charge you on the behalf of our only Lord and Maſter Chriſt Jeſus, and of his Spouſe the Church of God our dear Mother; aſſuring my ſelf that as thereby you ſhall diſtribute bleſſings, ſo many bleſſings from others ſhall redound unto your ſelf, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and in their prayers, and thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings to God for you.</p>
                  <p>We deny not what they of the <hi>Romane</hi> perſwaſion ſay, That the tradition of the Church is a great teſtimony; yea, take the univerſal Church in all ages, including that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and plain reaſon and experiment will enforce all men to acknowledge that a Divine teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. To which when that key hath let us in to the Scripture it ſelf, we find a light which manifeſts both it ſelf and other things, and ſo we have a ſecond te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony internal and both Divine.</p>
                  <p>The fallacy then is found in making the Churches inducing teſtimony to be the only or the principal, and then in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this atteſtation to the preſent Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> from whom we muſt (if they may prevail) receive theſe two things on truſt. That firſt, theirs is the Catholick Church; (as meer a Bull as that <hi>Tiber</hi> is
<pb facs="tcp:170280:3"/>all Rivers, or a whole Palace is in one room.) And ſecondly, that he who muſt be the head of the Church (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time confeſſed to be no true member) is abſolutely infallible.</p>
                  <p>Concerning which pretended infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity ſo long time contended for (though doubtleſſe their learned men hold and know it a point ridiculous, for in time of three Antipopes at once, chairing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at <hi>Rimini,</hi> at <hi>Bologne,</hi> and <hi>Abignon,</hi> about 1429. to which head was then this biggen of Infallibility bound?) it hath now pleaſed God in this laſt age to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce amongſt us ſuch worthies, as have beaten down this Babel of papal pride, and levell'd it with the ground. I mean this chiefly, by that monumental piece The conference of Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> with <hi>Fiſher,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s Book againſt <hi>Knot,</hi> another of the Jeſuits: On both which one made this Epigram;

                  </p>
                  <p>And for a further manifeſt of this, I refer you to a book of <hi>Hugh Paulin de Creſſie,</hi> once a Dean in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend of <hi>Windfor,</hi> who is gone over to <hi>Rome</hi> and publiſhed the motives of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I read his book newly extant in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> from the hand of a very worthy Matron, Ms. B. a zealous Papiſt, and ſhewed her therein where he openly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes That infallibility is a word unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate. That Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb facs="tcp:170280:4"/>againſt it with too too great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. He wiſhes the Word were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or at leaſt laid by: That we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtants have in very deed very much to ſay for our ſelves when we are preſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſarily with it; and adviſes his Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, that we may never be invited to combate the authority of their Church under that notion; And profeſſes no ſuch word as Infallibility is to be found in any Council, &amp;c. <hi>Magna eſt veritas</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We and they muſt of force yield to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 5.8. We were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (in the abſtract) and all our light in Dom. are now light in the Lord. But how? Certainly that <hi>Oriens ab Alto;</hi> that great Biſhop of all our ſouls, doth baptize all true believers with the holy Ghoſt, and with the celeſtial fires of his Grace: But ſince this Arch-prelate and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Superintendent (for properly all cure of ſouls, all Baptiſm and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is from that our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, and he) is in heaven, and his ſpirit muſt deſcend to and into us; which is the Aquaeduct, the ventiduct, the Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; which way doth Chriſt in his ſpirit and graces convey this holy water; this gentle air, this bleſſed light to our ſpirits?</p>
                  <p>Why, look back to the Creation; How came light at firſt? Firſt the ſpirit moves and broods o're that which was a depth and darkneſſe; and then his mighty Word, <hi>Fiat Lux.</hi> He ſpake, and it was Light; then when all was dark, he made material light: and Chriſt Jeſus is the
<pb facs="tcp:170280:4"/>word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; for as ſpeech is the image of the mind, ſo he the brightneſſe of his Father's glory, and the expreſſe image of his perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The immaterial and eternal light of light, that was never made. And the Divine ſpirit goes that way ſtill, by the Word: His word is, and makes light. This world is God's great book, wherein as in a glaſſe of wonders, we diſcern him. But his word is the true myrror of his mind: And as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd his form on his Son before all worlds, ſo what that Son is, and what the father is to us in him, the ſpirit procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from both delivers in the book of his word. The Sun guilds and enamels clouds and ſtreams and hill tops with his rays, but thruſts his own pure light, his own living fires through the bodies of the ſtars; ſo other authors can but yield a faint reflexion of that beam which here is native and direct; The very Law God ſtyles a flaming light; the Propheſies a more ſure word, to which we do well to attend as to a light ſhining in a dark place, till the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in our hearts. But the Goſpel is called his marvellous light: He brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 26.16. I have appeared to thee, ſaith our Saviour to that choice veſſel of his grace and name to make thee a Miniſter, and a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. And now I will ſend thee to the Gentiles: To what end? for a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious end: To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light; from the
<pb facs="tcp:170280:5"/>power of Satan unto God. And acord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſpeaks that Apoſtle, If our Goſpel be hid (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, &amp; 4. verſes) 'tis hid in them that periſh, in whom the god of this world hath blinded their unfaithful minds, that the light of the Goſpel of the glory of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould not ſhine unto them. And in the 6. verſe, he ſhews the walk and circuit of this light: God who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts, (there firſt, and then the caſting of the beam) to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus. Doth not S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, It is both the wiſedome and power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth? and is not that enough to give all men full ſatisfaction and acquieſcenſe? what a large field lies open for the further clearing this truth, in thoſe aſſertions in the fathers. Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> calls the holy Scriptures Lamps of Verity before our eyes.

And the ſtructure of this diſcourſe is framed and faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned like to <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ladder, to lift up the imagination of man from-Earth to Heaven: and to this end I have placed in it twelve arguments, as ſo many rounds or ſtairs, whereby the minds of rational men may be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up by each ſtep and gradation to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170280:8"/>a clearer ſpeculation and view of that celeſtial ſplendour, which is diffuſed throughout the whole regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Scripture, till at the length (namely by ſuch time as they have aſcended to the top of this ſcale) they may be able to diſcry and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern here in open view ſuch radiant beams of divine light, as will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpell and drive away all foggy miſts of ambiguity and heſitation, that ecclipſed and ſhadowed this light formerly from their ſight.

He likewiſe certified him further, That one <hi>Theodectes</hi> a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick Poet, intending to make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſome of his Poems of a certain Hiſtory written in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, was ſtricken blind; &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the cauſe thereof to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his audacious preſumption in that intent, was reſtored to his ſight after that he had appeaſed Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure;

Secondly, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved again, that by nine of the clock at night, the Moon was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn to a diametrous oppoſition to the Sun; which by courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not poſſibly come to paſſe in that ſpace of time, being but ſix hours. And this miracle <hi>Dionyſius</hi> entreated <hi>Polycarpus</hi> to urge <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> withal, to win him to the Chriſtian faith, in regard himſelf was an eye-witneſſe thereof. Again, the reſurrection of Chriſt hath open acknowledgement, both from <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> in the place twice above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170280:18"/>and from <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf that put him to death, by a Letter that he writ to his Lord <hi>Tiberius,</hi> then Emperor of <hi>Rome;</hi> wherein he certifies him how the Souldiers (who were ſuborned and hired by the Jews to ſay that Chriſts Diſciples came and ſtole him away in the night) had confeſſed the plain truth unto him; namely, that Jeſus was riſen indeed to life again out of his Sepulchre; and withall he ſent to <hi>Tiberius</hi> the particular examination of divers other perſons, which he had taken about the ſame buſineſſe, who avowed that they had ſeen and ſpoken with ſuch perſons as were riſen from death at that time with Jeſus; which ſaid perſons aſſured them alſo of his reſurrection. This Letter of <hi>Pilate's</hi> was laid up amongſt the records of the <hi>Romans;</hi> as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth both <hi>Aegeſippus</hi> in his Hiſtory, (who lived in the next Age after the Apoſtles) and immediately after him <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book againſt the Gentiles, where he profeſſeth that upon his own knowledge ſuch a Letter there was to be ſeen amongſt

                  <p>There have been indeed ſome men in former Ages, ſo advanced and exalted in their own thoughts, and tranſported with vain glory (having been mounted to the higheſt ſtair of honour and authority here upon Earth) that they have ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly affected to be called gods, and to be reputed to deſcend from more then humane race and parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; yet never durſt any of them perſonate the God of Heaven, to call themſelves Jehovah, or Elohim. But this is oft the affirmation of the Author of Scripture, as is evident
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170280:23"/>both from the Text laſt named, and from many other; of which I will rehearſe but theſe four, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. <hi>And God ſpake all theſe words ſaying, I am Jehovah thy God.

<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu∣ment. </seg>9</label> The certain accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe many propheſies and predictions of holy writ concerning things to come meerly cauſual and contingent, and no way depending upon natural cauſes, is an argument undeniable of the divinity of it; if it can be demonſtrated that the

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the precedence of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions both in the Old Teſtament and in the New before their events, I thus demonſtrate. Firſt, For the Old Teſtament, I will omit thoſe many predictions which were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled within the time of its own durance and continuance, as not demonſtrative to meer reaſon, that they were by divine inſpiration; and inſiſt onely in the propheſies about our Saviour Chriſt's incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, miracles and paſſion, and the vocation of the Gentiles to the Chriſtian faith, which were fulfilled
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170280:32"/>in the time of the Goſpel; which being proved to have been fulfilled a long time after their prediction by the Prophets, is an undeniable demonſtration that they were utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by inſpiration from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now that they were fulfilled a long time after their prediction, and that the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Pſalms, and the Prophets (where theſe predictions are recorded) were extant before the events, we have many pregnant proofs from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony both of Jews and Gentiles; and thoſe ſuch as lived in the very interval of tiem between the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies and their accompliſhment; Amongſt which the moſt remakable and famous is the <hi>Septuagints</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Old Teſtament into the Greek Tongue ſtill extant; which was done by the means, and at the charges of <hi>Ptolomy Philadelph,</hi> a King of <hi>Egypt</hi> (as before hath b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Elders of the Jews, out of every Tribe ſix: Which was doubtleſſe purpoſely brought to paſſe by God's all ſeeing and all-ſwaying providence, to take away all ſuſpicion of contriving the propheſies of Scripture after the events.

The truth hereof appears,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170280:36"/>firſt, from the books which <hi>Moſes</hi> writ, wherein he hath reported not only the cruelty of his grandfather <hi>Levi,</hi> to the diſcredit of his own birth; but alſo openly confeſſeth his own ſin, and how much the Lord was offended with him for it ſeveral times; ſo as he was therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred the entrance into the Land of

                  <p>In the eighth and laſt place,
<label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ar∣gument. </seg>12</label> the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible and ſupernatural power and efficacy of this word doth mightily declare it to be divine and heavenly, which it expreſſeth not by one or two acts, but by various operations, and thoſe ſpecifically diſtinct one from another, which ordinarily and frequently iſſue and proceed from it. More eſpecially we may obſerve theſe four ſupernaturl effects of it, as demonſtrative of its divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Firſt, It's a ſearcher of the heart, and a diſcerner of the moſt ſecret thoughts, and intricate ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of it, and a revealer of the ſame; this appears from <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14.1. where it ſpeaks thus, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart there is no God.</hi> Which affirmation imports, that the Inditer of the Pſalms was privy to ſome thoughts in the hearts of fools, which none but God himſelf can diſcern. Nay, Scripture reveals ſome ſuch thoughts, as man himſelf
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170280:37"/>without the light of it would ſeare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever have eſpied, as that <hi>All the thoughts and imaginations of mans heart are only evill</hi>

                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5.</note> 
                     <hi>continually.</hi> And that concupiſcence is ſin, which <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth he had not known, if the Law had not ſaid thou ſhalt not
<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7.</note> luſt. And therefore this word which pierceth thus deeply as to the rifling of the very cogitations of mans heart, muſt needs be of God, whoſe alone property it is to ſearch the heart; and leaſt through the propenſity of mans nature, to ſlight thoſe things which belong unto his peace, we ſhould neglect or overſlip the obſervation of this, as a note of the divine power of Scripture, it ſelf rounds us in the ear in two places (if not more) and gives us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence and notice of it. In one place it tells us, <hi>That the word of God</hi> (ſpeaking of this written word) <hi>is lively and mighty in operation, and ſharper then a two-edged ſword, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding between the ſoul and the ſpirit, and the joynts and marrow, and is a diſceruer of the thoughts and intents of the</hi>
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12.</note> 
                     <hi>heart.</hi> And in another
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170280:38"/>place it ſaith, That the illiterate unbelieving perſon, having the thoughts of his heart made manifeſt by propheſie (that is, by the word preached) will fall down on his face, and worſhip God, and report that God is in the
<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25.</note> Preacher. Where it gives us to underſtand, that the diſcovery of mens thoughts by the preaching of the word, ſhall extort from them this open and ingenuous confeſſion, that verily God ſpeaks in them, and that the word is his which is publiſhed by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſupernatural power of Scripture appears, in that it ſhakes and terrifies the conſciences of wicked men, even the greateſt upon earth, of Kings and Princes, and that in ſuch a ſort, as is impoſſible for the word of any mortal to do. That it doth ſo, is clear from theſe inſtances in Scripture: It's ſaid of <hi>Saul</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he was ſo affrighted with the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> his reproof of him for his diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God's word, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ſin to <hi>Samuel,</hi> which he had denied before; and ſued to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:170280:38"/>for favour with all
<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.24.</note> ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It's ſaid alſo of <hi>Felix</hi> (who was a Vice-roy) that he trembled when he heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and the judgement to
<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 24.26.</note> come. Now that mans word ſhould be thus formidable to Kings and Princes, it cannot be imagined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man hath coercive or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive power over the King; and where ſuch power is wanting, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacies from thence are no more feared then the crack of a paper gun; at leaſt not in that manner and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the affrighted conſciences of men do fear the thundrings and threatnings of the Law in Scripture. And therefore that word which ſtrikes ſuch deep horror and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the hearts of men, yea of Kings, (who fear no mans word, becauſe no man hath coercive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over them) muſt needs be more then humane.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It uſually prevails againſt the enemies and haters of it (ſuch as all men are by nature) to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſſe to light, and from the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170280:39"/>power of Satan unto God; and to win them to a love and liking of it ſelf, which is an effect proper only to divine power. That it doth produce this effect, I preſume no Chriſtians will deny; whence it teſtifieth of it ſelf, that it converts
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7.</note> ſouls; <hi>and is the power of God to</hi>
                     <note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</note> 
                     <hi>ſalvation. And that it's mighty through God to caſt down ſtrong holds; caſting down the imagination, and every high thing that is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of</hi>
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is a ſupernatural effect, and wrought by the power of this word; and therefore it neceſſarily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludingly follows, that it's not mans word; for that cannot work above the ſtrength of nature of or by it ſelf, neither can win the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of him that hates it, without a change or variation of it ſelf; which yet this word doth. If it be objected that it's not the power of the word, but the power of God's ſpirit that produceth this effect. I anſwer, that it's true indeed; that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170280:39"/>God's Spirit is the principal effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe hereof, but the word is the inſtrumental; and ſo the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and cooperation of the Spirit of God with this word, ſpeaks it to be his own ordinance, for elſe God would give no ſuch bleſſing to it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, It miniſters comfort above the power of nature to a depreſſed and diſtreſſed conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the greateſt extremities and preſſures of afflictions that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to this preſent life; yea, and in the very hour of death, againſt the fear both of death and hell, and condemnation, when all humane comforts ſhake hands with us and forſake us. And therefore extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf beyond the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alſo in this particular, it's appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently divine. That it doth mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comfort to wounded and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed conſciences needs no proof; it's confeſſed of all without contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, as having been proved by examples without number in all Ages: And that nothing elſe can either heal or comfort a wounded
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170280:40"/>and perplexed conſcience is as true too. Mirth and paſſime, with ſuch like avooations, and the ſociety of friends, may allay the ſmart of this wound for a time, but cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly heal it. It's this balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> this rod and this ſtaffe of God (which comforted

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170280:40"/>beſeech him to ſtay here his thoughts and to demur and pauſe a while upon this laſt reaſon or Argument, drawn from the power of Scripture to prove the divinity of it; for it's a very valid and powerful argument indeed, a moſt evident eviction of the point in hand, making it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to the eye of reaſon it ſelf; for here he may ſee God himſelf bearing witneſſe of this Scripture to be his, by four viſible ſeals which he affixeth unto it; which are theſe four ſupernatural effects now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Having therefore ſo many broad ſeals of Heaven appenſed unto it, it muſt needs hold forth from it ſelf, the higheſt and ſureſt ground of credibility, that it is of God and not of man.</p>
                  <p>I confeſſe this hath ſealed to my own conſcience, both that the Scripture is God's true word, and that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is God's true Church, (I mean one member and branch of it) for in it I ſee (and ſo may all that are in it, if their eyes be not holden with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice) theſe wonderful and divine
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170280:41"/>effects now mentioned, wrought ordinarily by the miniſtry of this Word in deed and in truth, and that without number; which could not poſſibly be ſo, if either the Word or the Church were not God's: For if the Church were his, and not the Word, the Church ſhould receive a bleſſing from him, but not by the Word: And if the Word were his, and not the Church, the Word ſhould be glorified, but the Church ſhould not be bleſſed or bettered by it. If all ſuch as now ſeparate themſelves from this Church, as if it were none of God's (whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or Anabaptiſts) would mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſider this, and lay aſide their prejudice; I cannot ſee what ſhould withhold them from a ſpeedy and joyful return to it again.</p>
                  <p>And now I am in good hope, (the promiſes being well conſidered) that the Readers, who before took the Scriptures for God's word upon the credit of the Churches teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will now (looking more inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively into them themſelves then heretofore) ſay to the Church as the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170280:41"/>
                     <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſaid to the woman that told them of Chriſt, Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have ſeen it our ſelves,
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.42.</note> and know that this is indeed God's own Word: Yet I would not here be miſtaken, as if I meant that every one that looks into Scripture might preſently eſpy this at the firſt ſight; for I confeſſe that the ſight and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain knowledge thereof (which is to be attained by this introſpection into it) is not obvious to every eye that looks upon it; but my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that this truth is evident in Scripture in it ſelf, and to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intelligent and inquiſitive Reader, whoſe mind is alſo prepared by the knowledge of the grounds &amp; principles of the Chriſtian faith, and in ſome meaſure inlightened from above.</p>
                  <p>Neither do I here ſlight or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue the Churches teſtimony; for I acknowledge it to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and uſeful for this purpoſe, as being a prime inducer, and as it were a paedagogue to uſher in and conduct us to the principal teacher
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170280:42"/>of this truth, which (next after the ſpirit of God himſelf) is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light of Scripture it ſelf; but it's neither laſt nor beſt, nor higheſt, nor ſureſt ground and proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: And therefore I deſire the Reader to take notice, that though I have not alledged the Churches teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by it ſelf as a particular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove this truth, (becauſe the drift of this Treatiſe, is to ſhew the Scripture it ſelf beſt to do it) yet is it involved and lapped up amongſt the external and leſſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal proofs, namely, in the ſecond and third arguments. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Papiſts glory much in that ſaying of S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> (which is oft ſet down in his works) <hi>Ego verò non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derem Evangelio, niſi me Catholicae Eccleſiae commoveret authoritas:</hi> That is, I would not believe the Goſpel, but that the authority of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Church moved me: As if this ſaying of his favoured their Tenet in this controverſie between us and them: It appears clearly to the contrary from another ſaying that he hath in his Tractate upon
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170280:42"/>the Goſpell of S. <hi>John,</hi> where he ſpeaks thus, upon thoſe words before mentioned of the <hi>Samaritans</hi> to the woman; <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have ſeen it our ſelves.

And the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſame place ſhew plainly his meaning to be this, That as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that Jeſus was the Chriſt, by the report of the woman; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more undoubtedly when they came to enjoy his preſence, to have the ſight of him, and conference with him: So the unbelievers which are out of the Church, are firſt induced to believe in ſome meaſure that Scripture is God's word, by the Churches enunciation and report; but afterwards they believe much more firmly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly when they come to enjoy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170280:43"/>the ſight and knowledge of the Scriptures themſelves. So that the moſt that can be gathered from that ſpeech of S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> is but this, That the teſtimony and tradition of the Church is uſually the firſt induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to men to give credit to the truth, and ſo conſequently to the divinity of the Goſpel, which is not denied. But then this credulity is afterwards corroborated and more fully ſetled and confirmed by more evident, certain and infallible groundsout of Scripture it ſelf; diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered eſpecially by the help of divine grace from the ſpirit of God; which of all other ſaith Amen to this truth, and ſets the ſureſt ſeal thereof upon the ſoul and conſcience; as our Saviour gives us to underſtand, when he ſaith, <hi>If any man will do God's will, he ſhall know of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine whether it be of</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170280:43"/>for as it ſuggeſted and dictated the Scripture at the firſt, ſo it whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in the ear of the ſoul the ſame note ſtill, and hath no diſcrepant voice or ſuggeſtion from it; but whatſoever it teſtifieth, it ſuggeſts the ſame not by any ſecret inſtinct and ſpiritual inſuſurration different from the written word (according to the vertiginous fancy and dotage of the Enthuſiaſts, the family of Love, (as they are phraſed) and ſome other of the Anabaptiſtical ſect) but by a ſtill voice out of and according to the Scripture.

<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 24.45.</note> Scriptures. And that when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend the Comforter unto them to teach them all things, he addeth, Whatſoever I have ſaid unto
<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 14.26.</note> you; which intimates that he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170280:44"/>ſhould teach them no new doctrine. So that we are not to believe an Angel from Heaven, if he preach any other Goſpel then that which the Apoſtles have
<note n="(c)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8.</note> preached; which we have written in the New Teſtament, And ſo it was ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways of old, To the Law, and to the Teſtimony; If they ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this word, it is becauſe there is no light in

                  <p>Thus then I conclude, That the conſcience may be verily reſolved, and a rational man compelled to acknowledge and believe with an acquired hiſtorical faith, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are divine, by convincing arguments and evidences apparent even to reaſon, and that from Scripture it ſelf eſpecially.

                     <p>Firſt, That no man may preſume to diſpenſe with this word, becauſe it's God's; for being his, none but he hath authority and power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt any man from obligation to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170280:45"/>it, or any part of it. This is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion undeniable, and therefore ſpeaks the practice of ſome late Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be very culpable and inexcuſable, who have preſumed to grant diſpenſations for marriages within the degrees forbidden in this word of God; and to exempt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from obedience to their lawful Soveraign, ſtrictly commanded in this word. This hath been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the Papal power of late years here in this Nation. And it's the more inexcuſable, in that they undertake to juſtifie it. This I find in Cardinal <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s works, who to prove the Popes Supremacy, draws an argument from his power to grant diſpenſations; and then doth inſtance in a diſpenſation which Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> granted to the Engliſh about marriages within the degrees

                     <p>A ſecond conſequent or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that I deduce from this truth, That Scripture is God's own word, is this, That therefore it's of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and greater authority then the preſent Church militant. And this I prove from hence by two reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Becauſe the preſent Church Militant is holy and divine, but only in part, and after a ſort; and in this regard is ſubject unto error; whereas the Scripture is ſimply and totally divine; for <hi>All Scripture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> ſaith

                     <p>If any ask againſt whom I take up this weapon, ſeeing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſeems to diſclaim and diſavow this Tenet: For the Rhemiſts in their Annotations on <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2. affirm the diſputation of this queſtion to be ſuperfluous, and the compariſon to be altogether unfit to be made; I anſwer in the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>So fight I, not as one that beateth the</hi>

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170280:47"/>take up Arms againſt the wind. For beſides divers others hereafter mentioned, the ſaid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors (who would ſeem to decline this opinion, and this unſeemly compariſon) do in the very ſame place depreſſe the Scriptures, and make them inferiour to the Church in four reſpects: 1. In reſpect of Antiquity; in that the Church was before them. 2. In excellence of nature; in that the Church is the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Temple of God, and the proper ſubject of God and his graces; for which Church the Scriptures were, and not the Church for the Scriptures. 3. In power of judging; the Church ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving judicial power to determine of doubtful queſtions touching the ſenſe of the Scriptures, and other controverſies of Religion; of which judicial power the Scriptures are not capable. 4. In evidence; the definitions of the Church being more clear and evident then thoſe of the Scriptures. Now if by the Church they underſtood the whole Catholique Church (and ſo included
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170280:47"/>all the Patriarks, Prophets and Apoſtles, by whom the Scriptures were penned) the conteſtation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and them would not be ſo irreconcileable. But their drift is to entitle the preſent Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant (which is but one ſmall part of the whole Catholique Church) to thoſe glorious prerogatives which belong not unto it. And that it's this Church which they ſo ſtrive to advance above the Scriptures, it's more then manifeſt outof the writings of many of their Authors of ſpecial note amongſt them; as namely out of <hi>Pighius, Melchior Canus,</hi> and <hi>Stapleton:</hi> All which in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings quoted in the margent

                     <p>Hitherto of the Theological con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions inferred from this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, That Scripture is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively divine. Now it follows to ſpeak of ſome duties for practice, that may be raiſed and urged upon all ſorts of perſons from it; and namely, both upon Magiſtrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This challengeth from all Chriſtian Kings and Princes (who are God's Vice-roys upon Earth) all honourable reſpect, patronage and poſſble protection of this holy word of God, againſt all religions and opinions in Religion, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170280:48"/>are repugnant unto it; and againſt all perſons, that either in word or deed, doctrine or life, ſlight or diſhonour it. For they ſuſtaining the perſon of God here on earth (for which they are dignified with the title of gods themſelves in this

                     <p>Thus the Scepter was never taken away from the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> ſo long as they ſwayed it for the defence of God's word; but while they were obſervant of it, God was propitious to them.</p>
                     <p>Nor doth this duty lie ſolely upon
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170280:49"/>the higheſt powers, but upon all ſecondary and ſubordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, both Counſellors of State, Nobles, Judges, and Juſtices, whom god hath advanced to ſuch high places of honour, and put into their hands the ſword of juſtice, for this very end primarily, that they might weild it according to his word, and for it; according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and rules that he hath inſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; and for the ſupport of the honour and authority of it, by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and ſuppreſſing all impious ſcorners, prophaners, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors thereof. And verily when they do thus execute juſtice by the word of God, and for it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out connivence or partiality; then are they the very nerves and ſinews of the body of the Commonwealth, and bring both ſtrength and glory unto it.

I have read, that ever in the firſt and beſt Councels (as in the Councels of <hi>Chalcedon, Nice,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi>) the holy Orthodox Fathers and Biſhops were wont to have the Bible placed on a desk, or ſuch like convenient ſupporter in the midſt of the room before them, that by the ſight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they might be put in mind to conclude and determine nothing againſt the honour and contents thereof. It were to be wiſhed, that all in place of Magiſtracy and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature would be pleaſed ſo far forth to follow the example of theſe grave and reverend Fathers, as to have this Book of God, if not in their hands, or before their eyes, yet at leaſt in their mindes and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries at all times, when they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170280:51"/>about the adminiſtration of juſtice and judgement; that it might be a remembrance unto them to do nothing againſt the contents of it, as they deſire to eſcape the curſes that are denounced in it againſt ſuch as violate the ſacred laws and rules of it.</p>

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170280:58"/>it: For the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> in their front of their Preface prefixed before their tranſlation of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, affirm it to be an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion to hold that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were ordained of God to be read indifferently of all: And therefore the Councel of Trent took order, which was confirmed by ſupreme authority (ſay the ſame Doctors in the ſame place, within a few lines after) that the holy. Scriptures might not be read in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently of all men, nor of any other then ſuch as have expreſſe licenſe from their lawful Ordinary; Whereby it appears that they ſeek to detain the Scriptures from the vulgar people, purpoſely to keep them in ignorance: And to put a little gloſſe and colour upon this their in juſtifiable opinion and practice, the ſaid Doctors after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards yield this reaſon for it; Becauſe preſumptuous Hereticks, miſtaking or depraving in many places the true ſenſe of Scripture, draw from thence many perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious errours; and many other
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170280:59"/>that are unlearned and unſtable, pervert the ſame to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, as S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</note> teacheth. And how weak a ground this is for them to preſume from hence to reſtrain the common reading of Scripture, I declare theſe two ways.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, This Argument takes for granted, that the abuſe of a good thing by ſome, nulls and takes away the lawful common uſe of it from others: But this is nothing ſo, for the word preached as well as read, is abuſed by many through their corruption; and ſo becomes the <hi>ſavour of death unto death unto</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170280:60"/>enter into by the quotation of thoſe many Texts of Scripture, which yield very copious teſtimony to it, and will only endeavour to faſten this exhortation upon all, with theſe two reaſons. Firſt, we ſee by experience of the time paſt, that all things are fulfilled, and ſtill come to paſſe dayly according to this word, and agreeably to the voice and tenour of it; which therefore urgeth upon us a belief of the whole contents of it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things yet to come; for if the event hath proved it to ſpeak truth in all things that it hath foretold ſhould come to paſſe; then even common reaſon binds us to believe it to utter the truth in all things alſo that it foretels are yet to come: As (we ſee) experience of mans mortality by the extinction of former generations, makes all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly believe the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of for all ſucceeding ages. Now that Scripture predictions have at all times come to paſſe in their ſeaſons, I could produce numerous atteſtations both out of the Old
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170280:60"/>Teſtament and the New; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the moſt of them are well known of all, I will rehearſe but only two of ſpecial note; one of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and another of King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Joſhua</hi> in his time ſpeaks thus to the children of <hi>Iſrael; Behold this day I am going the way of all the Earth; and ye know in all your hearts, and in all your ſouls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the Lord your God ſpake concerning you; all are come to paſſe unto you, and not one thing hath failed</hi>

                        <hi>thereof.</hi> This <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpake purpoſely to faſten upon them a ſtable belief of the fulfilling of ſuch Scripture predictions as then were to come; as appears from his words following in the next verſe, where he adds theſe words, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall come to paſſe, that as all good things are come upon you, which the Lord your God, promiſed you; ſo ſhall the Lord bring upon you all evill things, untill be have deſtroyed you from off this good Land, which the Lord your God hath given you.</hi> The like atteſtation here of gave <hi>Solomon</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:170280:61"/>in his time afterwards; <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that hath given reſt unto his people Iſrael, according to all that he promiſed; there hath not failed one word of all his good promiſe, which he promiſed by the hand of</hi> Moſes <hi>his</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, Seeing we are ſure that Scripture is Gods word, it's wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for all perſons to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that Society of Chriſtian profeſſors which moſt honours it, and holds beſt correſpondence and agreement with it. Now becauſe the main controverſie is between the <hi>Romane</hi> and the reformed Chriſtian profeſſors, I will (as compendiouſlly as I can, and as truly as I have read in approved Authors of both ſides) open and declare which of theſe aſcribes moſt honour and reverence to the Bible of God, and beſt accordeth and conſpireth with it. And firſt, For the honour done unto it of both: The reformed Churches acknowledge it a moſt perfect and abſolute rule of life, both for faith and manners; to which nothing may be added, and from which nothing may be detracted; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſentence of the holy Ghoſt in divers places of the ſame Book: <hi>Ye ſhall not add to the word which I command you, neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170280:63"/>and deſerved) titles to it, which they learn and gather out of it; ſome whereof I will mention: They call it, The Oracle of God; the Breath of the holy Ghoſt; the Scepter of Chriſt's Kingdom; the Touch-ſtone of truth; the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> the Myſtery of Godlineſſe, and the Lamb's Book; with many other ſuch like: Now by all this it appears that they give that due and condigne honour, veneration and obſervance to the ſacred Scripture, which becomes the true and ſincere profeſſors and defenders of it. See now on the other ſide, what honour the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts exhibite to it, and in what eſtimation they have it: Sometime they celebrate it with due venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and call it The true word of God, and a moſt certain and ſafe rule of faith; ſo <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſpeaks of it, and affirms it to be the mind of the Catholique Church, and the Councel of

                     <p>Firſt, They teach that the proper and principal end of Scripture was not to be the rule of faith, but to be a uſeful monitor (or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer) to conſerve and nouriſh the doctrine received by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: This is out of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> word for

                     <p>Secondly, They affirm that the whole Chriſtian doctrine, which is neceſſary to be known either for faith or manners, is not contained in the Scriptures; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is required an unwritten word alſo beſide the written word; that is to ſay, Divine and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical traditions, to be added to the written word, to make it a perfect

                     <p>Now if the truth of Chriſtian Religion may be judged by the honourable reſpect yielded by the profeſſors thereof to the rule of Chriſtian Religion, which is the Scripture, (as the Romaniſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe after a ſort, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared) then doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by what hath been ſaid and proved, that the Reformed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion is the trueſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as which aſcribes moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thereunto: For as when two women claimed the motherhood of one child, wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> quickly ſifted out the truth, which was the true mother of it, by the tender love and affection which the one ſhewed unto it more then the

                     <p>In the next place; as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion is owned by the Scripture as the genuine daughter thereof, by the due reverence and honour which it exhibiteth unto it; ſo alſo and more eſpecially, becauſe it holdeth forth ſuch do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as is moſt conſonant and agreeable thereunto: For (to omit the diſquiſition of particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies between the ſaid ſeveral profeſſors, which would require vaſt volumes to lay open) the Reformed Churches refuſe not to be tryed by the ſplendent light of the written word, in any point of Religion whatſoever. And this our bleſſed Saviour makes a ſignal demonſtration of the profeſſors of the truth; for (ſaith he) <hi>He that doth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds might be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in</hi>

                     <p>The advice is this, That ſeeing Scripture is a moſt ſure and ſafe rule of faith; and that by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion both of Papiſts, and the greateſt number and major part of Anabaptiſts; it's wiſedome for all ſuch as deſire to walk by a ſafe rule, to decline and deſert all aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation and communion with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Sects; as who gain-ſay and contradict it in divers
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170280:72"/>points of their faith, as hath been demonſtrated; and to adhere to the profeſſors of the reformed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, and to hold communion with them; as who aſcribe moſt honour and reverence unto it, and hold beſt correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and agreement with it, in all points of Chriſtian belief.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly and laſtly, This is not all that's needful, to know, honour and believe Scripture, and profeſſe the true Religion, which beſt agreeth with it; but we muſt ſow the ſeeds of good works alſo in obedience to the precepts and commandements of it, becauſe they are God's commandements; or all the former will be as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe unto us, as the husbandman's ground that's tilled and dreſſed, but never ſown; or the garment that's made, but never worn; or the skill in humane arts and ſciences, whether liberal or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical, that is acquired, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed: This practical part of Religion is ſo abundantly and vehemently called for, as of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

But I know it's the rationality and ſolidity, the ſtrength and not the length of a diſcourſe, that beſt pleaſeth, and moſt prevaileth: And therefore I will but only propound certain rules neceſſary to be obſerved, that our obedience may be an accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervice to God, and profitable to our ſelves, and ſo conclude; which I will reduce to theſe four heads.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, We muſt ſee that our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

So ſaith S. <hi>James, Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of</hi>

The common objection of an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to keep perfectly all the commandements, is as commonly anſwered; that though legally we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170280:74"/>cannot, yet evangelically we may: For out of the evangelical part of Scripture we learn, that in and through Jeſus Chriſt (by whom all our ſpiritual ſacrifices are made acceptable unto God, as the Scripture
<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</note> teacheth) the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned purpoſe and ſincere deſire, and true endevour, to obſerve and do all that God commands us, is accepted of God for perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; albeit we fail ſometimes in ſome things beſide our purpoſe, and of infirmity: For as he laies no more upon us, in his great mercy then we are able to bear, as the Apoſtle
<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</note> teacheth; ſo he looks for no more from us, then we are enabled to do by the help of his aſſiſtant grace; but <hi>ſpareth us as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth</hi>

                     <hi>HAving a Pamplet acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally put into my hands, twiſted of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, incongruities, and miſapplications and depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of holy Scripture; entituled</hi> (The order of cauſes; Of God's foreknowledge, electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and predeſtination; and of mans ſalvation or damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) <hi>I thought I might do a charitable work to detect the impoſtures of it; Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that it had gotten ſome entertainment with ſome perſons within mine own charge and cure. For albeit there be little hope of prevailing with theſe falſe teachers (in theſe times eſpecially, which have ſo long connived at their erroneous and ſeditious courſes) to renounce their errors, though never ſo fairly and fully confuted; as
<pb facs="tcp:170280:79"/>who have reſolved to hold the concluſion, whether the premiſes be true or falſe; (which every Novice in Logick knows to be an abſurdity to be hiſſed at) yet may this detection of their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in ſome meaſure prevent the further diffuſion and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their pernicious errors; which is the fole end, wherefore theſe plain enſuing lines were haſtily compiled and penned. And in this regard the courteous Reader is intreated to vouchſafe a candid and benevolent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of them; as which, upon more mature deliberation, might either have been kept private, or appearing in publique, might happily have been clad in a more ſightly dreſſe; which is the humble requeſt of</hi>

                  <p>IT hath ever been the artifice and deceitfull dealing of Hereticks, to pick out ſome ſuch Texts of Scripture, wherewith to cloak their errors, as by their falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them (in not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with other Texts of Scripture treating of the ſame ſubject) might afford ſome colour and countenance unto them.</p>
                  <p>Thus the old Serpent (the firſt deviſer of this fallacy) dealt with our bleſſed Saviour, when he temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him in the Wilderneſſe; he alledged a piece of Scripture out of <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 91.11. where it's ſaid, <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keep thee,</hi> and skips over the next words, <hi>in all thy ways,</hi> and ſo goeth to the 12. <hi>verſe,</hi> as knowing that the words which he left out, would quite alter the Text from that purpoſe for which he alledged the ſame. And thus deal the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Sectaries and Separatiſts that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170280:80"/>are of late ſtarted up; They alledge ſome ſayings of Scripture, which, (conſidered by themſelves without any reference had to other Texts of Scripture, which afford light to the right meaning of them) ſeem at the firſt ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial view of them, to ſpeak ſomething for them, about ſome of their erroneous Tenets; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as compared with other ſayings of Scripture, where the ſame point is more fully and plainly expreſſed, they make nothing at all for proof of that for which they are alledged, as ſhall be diſcovered in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in this enſuing Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt a Fardle of their pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable and prodigious Errors (ſome whereof are utterly unworthy the refutation, being manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of holy Scripture; As their denial of Faith to be the gift of God; which I have heard to proceed out of the mouth of divers of no ſmall eſteem amongſt them with incredible impudence, I have here undertaken the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe ſix, (of which ſome
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170280:80"/>are Popiſh) which I find in the fornamed book, and in another which I ſhall hereafter mention.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. They affirm, <hi>That God's election of men to ſalvation, is from his fore-ſight of their Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: Or</hi> (as ſome of them phraſe it) <hi>from his fore-ſight of their Sanctification and Good Works.</hi>

                     <item>2. <hi>That Chriſt's Redemption is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, extending it ſelf to all men in the World,</hi> indiſcriminatim, <hi>indifferently.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>That men have Free-will to repent and believe, and ſo may be ſaved if they will.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. <hi>That Good Works, or Obedience, are meritorious cauſes of ſalvation.</hi>

                     <item>5. <hi>That children are not born in ſin.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>6. <hi>That the payment of Tithes to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, is not agreeable to Scripture.</hi>

                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:170280:81"/>
                  <p>Now that theſe are falſe Tenents, not juſtifiable from Scripture, but repugnant unto it; I ſhall (I hope) make manifeſt to all that are not byaſſed with prejudice.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe I am not to enter the Liſts and conteſt with perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious Adverſaries, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time will neither hear right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor yield to Scripture, but as they themſelves ſhall expound it: It will be expedient for me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe certain Theological concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or principles (which all Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines, unanimouſly and univocally have acknowledged to be undoubted Truths) as <hi>Praecog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita,</hi> and Canons to have recourſe unto, for the deciſion and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of any Controverſie as need ſhall require; which if they deny to aſſent unto, they are not to be diſputed with, as the proverb ſpeaks, <hi>Contra negantem principia non eſt diſputandum:</hi> There's no diſputation to be held with him that will deny the principles of Art.</p>
                  <p>The Principles I think fit to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe are theſe four:</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:170280:81"/>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Canonical Scripture is</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>that is, authentical and creditable of it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That there is no contradictions in the Canonical Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That the ſame makes (and ſo by conſequence alloweth to be made) diſtinction between things that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in Scripture have the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination.</hi> This appears by many inſtances in Scripture, whereof I will name theſe three, <hi>Fear, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, About <hi>Fear;</hi> the Scripture mentioneth a fear which is gracious and godly (which the learned have termed Filial;) and a Fear which is graceleſſe (which the learned have termed Servile;) of this we have an example in 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.33, 34. where it's ſaid of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> in the former verſe, <hi>that they feared God;</hi> and then in the latter verſe, <hi>that they feared him not.</hi> Whence it's evident that a diſtinction muſt be made of the fear of God; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome is a Gracious Fear, and ſome a Graceleſſe; otherwiſe there would be a contradiction between
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170280:82"/>the two <hi>verſes,</hi> which Scripture admits not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, About <hi>Faith,</hi> The Scripture doth diſtinguiſh it into theſe two ſorts, namely a Faith that hath Works, and a Faith that is without works, which it alſo calleth a dead faith, <hi>James</hi> 2.17. <hi>Faith, if it have no Works, is dead being alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, About <hi>Sorrow,</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of a godly ſorrow for ſin, and a worldly ſorrow, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Godly ſorrow worketh Repentance to ſalvation, but the ſorrow of the World worketh death.</hi> Hereby it's clear, that a diſtinction is ſometimes to be made betwixt things that have the ſame deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Principle which I ſhall premiſe is this, <hi>That ſeeming contradictions in Scripture are ſo to be expounded by help of other Texts (either ſpeaking of the ſame point or otherwiſe) that they may ſymphonize and accord together.</hi> Which help the Scripture affords in one place or other.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:170280:82"/>
                  <p>If our Adverſaries will yield to be tryed about the forementioned Controverſies by theſe old Canons (which have been univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for undoubted truths by all Chriſtian Churches in primitive times, when the waters ran cleareſt from under the Threſhold of the Sanctuary) I ſhall adventure to bear the diſgrace, if I do not convince them of error about each Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, that I have before named.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="controversy">
                     <head>The firſt Controverſie handled. About Election.</head>
                     <p>THeir firſt Error that I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to confute, is their aſſertion, <hi>That God's election of men unto ſalvation, is grounded upon his foreſight of their Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or ſanctification and Good Works;</hi> That is, that he electeth ſuch and ſuch men to life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, becauſe he foreſeeth that they will believe and walk in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commandements.</p>
                     <p>This Aſſertion I ſhall prove to be an error by theſe four Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:170280:83"/>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The firſt Argument.</hi> If men ſhall therefore believe, becauſe they are elected and ordained to eternal life, then they are not elected and ordained to eternal life becauſe they will believe. This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cannot be denied by any intelligent man.</p>
                     <p>But men ſhall therefore believe, becauſe they are elected and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to eternal life; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not elected and ordained to it, becauſe they will believe.</p>
                     <p>The Aſſumption I prove out of <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. where it's ſaid, <hi>That as many as were ordained to eternall life believed.</hi> Here Faith is made the fruit and effect of election to eternal life, and therefore cannot be the cauſe of it; for nothing can be the cauſe and effect too, of one and the ſame thing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>My ſecond Argument is this.</hi> If men be elected or choſen that they may be holy, then their election muſt needs be the ground and cauſe of their holineſſe and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification. But men are elected that they may be holy; ſo ſaith
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170280:83"/>the Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He hath choſen us in him before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love.</hi> Therefore Election is the ground and cauſe of holineſſe or ſanctification, and not holineſſe the ground and cauſe of election.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The third Argument.</hi> If the good pleaſure of God's will be the ground and firſt cauſe of mens ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and predeſtination to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then God's fore-ſight of their Sanctification and Good Works, cannot be the firſt cauſe and ground thereof. This conſequence is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.</p>
                     <p>But the good pleaſure of God's will is the firſt cauſe and ground of mens election and predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, God's fore-ſight of their ſanctification and Good Works cannot be the firſt cauſe and ground thereof.</p>
                     <p>The A ſumption I prove from theſe two Texts of Scripture, (paſſing by many other to the ſame purpoſe) <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170280:84"/>there affirms, <hi>That the purpoſe of God, according to Election, ſtands not of Works, but of him that calleth.</hi> Where works are denied, and Gods will affirmed to be the cauſe of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. and again <hi>verſe</hi> 11. the good pleaſure of God's will, is made the ground and cauſe of mens election to ſalvation. The words in the fift <hi>verſe</hi> are theſe; <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of children by Jeſus Chriſt unto himſelf, according to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his will.</hi> And the words in the 11. <hi>verſe</hi> are theſe; <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the councel of his own will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the Adverſaries anſwer, that Election may be according to the good pleaſure of God's will, and yet the good pleaſure of his will may not be the cauſe of Election.</p>
                     <p>To this I reply, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle makes it plain in the 11. <hi>verſe,</hi> that he ſpeaks of the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God's will, as the cauſe of Election, by the addition of theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170280:84"/>laſt words in the <hi>verſe, Who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi> For if he worketh all things after the counſel of his own will, then Election is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily one of thoſe things which he worketh after the councel of his own will; and therefore the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of his own will muſt needs be the cauſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The fourth Argument is this,</hi> If Good Works be no cauſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, then neither of election unto ſalvation; this is plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Election is the cauſe of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                     <p>But Good Works are no cauſes of ſalvation, and therefore no cauſes of Election.</p>
                     <p>The minor Propoſition or Aſſumption is proved by <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, &amp; 9, <hi>verſes,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And again, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170280:85"/>us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Adveſaries anſwer, <hi>That theſe and ſuch like Texts are ſpoken of works before regeneration.</hi> To which I reply, that in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. the Apoſtle expreſly nominates works of righteouſneſſe, and denies them to be any cauſes of ſalvation; but there be no works of righteouſneſſe before regeneration; for then an evill tree ſhould bring forth good fruit, which our Saviour denies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.18. And therefore even good works after regeneration are in Scripture denied to be any cauſes of ſalvation. Hereof I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hereafter; and therefore will not inſiſt any longer in the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of it.</p>
                     <p>Before I proceed to the next Controverſie, I will diſplay the weak argumentation of Mr. <hi>Henry Haggar,</hi> for defence of election from fore-ſeen ſanctification; by his ſtraining Scripture from its proper ſenſe, and in not compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with other Scripture, where
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170280:85"/>the genuine and proper ſenſe is clearly explained. He toils him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prove the ſaid point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it's ſaid in 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. that men are choſen to ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit; and therefore thence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects that they are not choſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſanctified by the Spirit, which is a very inconſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent collection; for it doth not follow, that becauſe men are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation through ſanctification of the Spirit, that therefore ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of the Spirit is the cauſe of their election, or that therefore it precedes their election; but that therefore ſanctification is a neceſſary antecedent, way and means, through which they muſt be brought to ſalvation, whereto they are elected: as the way to any place, is not the cauſe of a man his coming thither, but only a neceſſary requiſite to be obſerved of him. And thus this Text fitly agrees with other Texts of Scripture, as that before mentioned, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. where it's ſaid, That <hi>we are choſen,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170280:86"/>that we ſhould be holy;</hi> which Text he hath waved and never mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all; but as Satan alledged the words of the Pſalmiſt, leaving out a part, as knowing it would diſcloſe his wreſting and pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true ſenſe of the other Text which he alledged. And ſo he neglects the premiſed rule of expounding Scripture by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is of neceſſity to be obſerved to find out the true ſenſe and meaning of any Text that is ambiguous, or may be variouſly expounded.</p>
                     <p>He alledgeth alſo the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. where it's ſaid, <hi>That men are elected according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit;</hi> Whence he col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, that God knows men firſt before he doth elect them.</p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, That God's preſcience or foreknowledge of men, and his election of them, are in him together, and one and the ſame act; for all his attributes are himſelf, and whatſoever is ſaid to be in him is himſelf, as it
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170280:86"/>hath ever been acknowledged by all learned Divines. But in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane apprehenſion of them, his decrees precede his preſcience, for he doth not decree things to come, becauſe he foreſees them, but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees them becauſe he hath decreed them; as is colligible from S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſpeech before named, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. where he affirms that God worketh all things according to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of his own will; whence it's manifeſt, that his own will is the firſt cauſe of all his works, and not his preſcience, though his preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence do concur with his will.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That the foreknowledge of God there men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is a foreknowledged with approbation; for the original word, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> properly ſignifies fore knowledgement; (as all men of learning know) which implies a concurence of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and approbation with his foreknowledge of men; and not any precedence of his knowledge before his approbation and electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170280:87"/>
                     <p>And this affords an anſwer alſo to that place which is brought by ſome of the adverſaries for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of election from foreſeen faith and holineſſe; in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. where it's ſaid, that <hi>whom God did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son;</hi> where the Greek verb, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> ſignifies properly <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acknowledged;</hi> which intimates an election either with it or before the foreknowledge; and beſides the words following lead to this ſenſe, in that the Apoſtle expreſſeth that the predeſtination which he mentioneth as a ſequell of God's foreknowledge, is a predeſtination to be conformed to the image of his Son, that is, <hi>to be holy as Chriſt is holy.</hi> A predeſtination to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe cannot be a predeſtination for holineſſe, as was ſhewed before. He alledgeth but one Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more about this point (which is in the fourth Page of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and which he abuſeth very ſufficiently as he doth the two former) and that is <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170280:87"/>and 12. <hi>verſes;</hi> where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of himſelf and others, that they were predeſtinated, that they ſhould be to the praiſe of God's glory, who firſt truſted in Chriſt. Whence he ridiculouſly collecteth, that they did firſt truſt in Chriſt before they were prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated. Whereas the priority or precedency of their faith there mentioned by the Apoſtle, hath no relation at all to their predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Grammatical conſtruction; but to the faith of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that were Greeks or Gentiles, and called to the faith of Chriſt after <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles that were Jews; as appears evidently by the next verſe, where the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle adds, <hi>In whom alſo ye truſted after that ye heard the word of truth.</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, In whom we truſted firſt, and then ye after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which agrees alſo with other Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. where the Apoſtle ſaith, that the Goſpel is the power of God to ſalvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew firſt, and alſo to the Greek.</p>

                     <head>The ſecond Controverſie. Of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</head>
                     <p>TO decide and determine this controverſie, I muſt firſt ſtate the queſtion aright between us and the adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>To ſpeak nothing of the word <hi>(All)</hi> which ſometimes is put for <hi>all ſorts of men,</hi> and ſometimes for <hi>all particular men of all ſorts.</hi> See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we acknowledge that Chriſt died not only for all ſorts of men, but for all of all ſorts, that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe.</p>
                     <p>The controverſie depends upon theſe three Quaeries. 1. <hi>Whether Chriſt died for unbelievers at all or not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Whether he died for them in as full and ample ſenſe as for believers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>In what ſenſe he died for them; and in what ſenſe he died not for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the firſt quaery or queſtion, I anſwer affirmatively (for my part) that Chriſt died for unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in ſome ſenſe.</p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:170280:88"/>
                     <p>To the ſecond I anſwer nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that he died not for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers in as full and ample ſenſe as for believers; which I prove from Scripture three ways. Firſt, Becauſe it's ſaid ſometime in Scripture, that he died for many as well as for all; as Iſa. 53.12. <hi>He bare the ſins of many.</hi> Matth. 20.28. <hi>He gave his life a ranſome for many.</hi> Heb. 9.28. <hi>Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many.</hi> Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions import, that he died not for all alike; but for many in one ſenſe, and for all in another; or elſe the expreſſion of his dying for many were needleſſe, in that it is ſo oft expreſſed that he died for all. Secondly, Becauſe it's oft ſaid, that he died for his Church; as <hi>John</hi> 10.15. <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep.</hi> Eph. 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Which imports alſo that he died for all men in one ſenſe, and for his Church in another. Thirdly, becauſe the Scripture hath <hi>(in terminis)</hi> in expreſſe words, put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170280:89"/>his being a Saviour to all men, and his being a Saviour to them that believe; as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. <hi>We truſt in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, ſpecially of thoſe that believe.</hi> From whence I argue thus; Chriſt died for all men, as he is a Saviour of all men; but he is a Saviour of all men in a different ſenſe and ſort; namely generally of the univerſality of men, and ſpecially of his Church; (witneſſe the diſtinction made by the Apoſtle in the fore-cited Text) Therefore he died for all men in a different ſenſe and ſort; namely in one ſenſe and ſort for the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality of men; and in another ſenſe and ſort for the particularity of his Church.</p>
                     <p>To the third Quaery I anſwer; That he died for all wicked men and unbelievers, in theſe two ſenſes according to Scripture. 1. As ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſatisfactory puniſhment for the ſins of all the men in the world, ſo as they are not left deſtitute of the means of remiſſion of ſins and of ſalvation, according to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170280:89"/>words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave himſelf a ranſome for all,</hi> a teſtimony in due time. And again, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. the Apoſtle ſaith that <hi>He taſted death for every man.</hi> 2. He died for them upon condition of their faith and obedience, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe Scriptures, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>He became the author of eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all them that obey him.</hi> And ſo in like manner it's the affirmation of ſundry other Texts of Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But then he died not for them with an intention and purpoſe to give them grace to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and ſo to bring them to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; which appears by Scripture to be a clear truth theſe two ways. 1. Becauſe Scripture hath revealed abundantly God's purpoſe to the contrary, namely to ſave ſome men, but not all; The proofs whereof
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170280:90"/>are ſo numerous, that I need not quote any. 2. Becauſe if Chriſt died for all men, with an intention and purpoſe to ſave all, then either all ſhall be ſaved (which is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by a hundred places of Scripture) or elſe Chriſt's purpoſe may be altered: But his purpoſe cannot be altered or diſappointed; and therefore he died not for all, with a purpoſe to ſave all. That his purpoſe cannot be altered I prove, both becauſe he can neither alter it himſelf, nor can any other alter it. That he cannot alter it himſelf is oft taught in Scripture, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not. Jam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>With him is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning.</hi> Neither can any other alter it, for his purpoſe is immutable, and his will irreſiſtible, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. <hi>My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi> And 43.13. <hi>I will work, and who ſhall let it?</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus then from the premiſes already ſufficiently proved, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and determine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170280:90"/>thus: That Chriſt died for all the men in the world in theſe two ſenſes. Firſt, As paying by his death a ſufficient ranſome for the ſins of them all; which the Scripture calls <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a price of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption ſeveral times. Secondly, That he died for them all upon condition of their faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but died not for all men with purpoſe to bring all actually to ſalvation. And ſo the old di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Chriſt's dying for all men, either <hi>ſufficientur</hi> or <hi>efficaciter,</hi> ſufficiently or effectually (as it may be underſtood and applied) ſtands ſtill upon its <hi>baſis</hi> and feet; and challengeth all the deſertors and rejecters of it to frame a more fit and proper diſtinction between Chriſt's dying for all men, and his dying for his Church. Seeing a diſtinction between them is to be made (as hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) by teſtimony of Scripture.</p>

                     <p>And then ſecondly, How far it cooperates with God's grace in his converſion.</p>
                     <p>About the firſt, notice is to be taken of a threefold liberty of Will; namely, <hi>The liberty of Nature, the liberty of Grace,</hi> and <hi>the liberty of Glory:</hi> Of which, though theſe two laſt we loſt by <hi>Adam's</hi> fall, yet the firſt was not loſt, but remains ſtill; ſo as by vertue thereof the Will hath liberty to will or nill without compulſion or conſtraint, and that not only in natural and civil actions, but alſo in moral and eccleſiaſtical. In moral actions to practiſe virtue, as Juſtice, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Liberality, &amp;c. And ſo to do ſome things commanded in God's Law, as both experience ſhews, and <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. where be ſaith, <hi>That the Gentiles did by nature the things contained in the Law.</hi> In Eccleſiaſtical actions an unregenerate man hath liberty alſo, namely, to perform the duties of God's worſhip and ſervice for the outward act; as to come to Church, hear and read the word of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170280:92"/>God, pray, partake of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, do works of charity, and confer about Religion and the doctrine of faith, as common expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhews; all which are good preparatives to, and ofttimes effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious means of regeneration and converſion. Yet muſt this liberty of Will about all theſe actions, either of doing them, or leaving them undone, be underſtood with this caution; ſo far forth as God ſhall be pleaſed to afford both the concurrence of his general and divine providence, (which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth all creatures to motion and action) and the concurrence of his common reſtraining grace, which in ſome meaſure, more or leſſe, he affordeth promiſcuouſly to all ſorts of men, both regenerate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170280:92"/>rehearſe the Adverſaries aſſertion, (amongſt which the Papiſts are chief, and leaders to the reſt) and then the aſſertion of the Reformed Churches. The Papiſts ſay, That the will of man before regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can by the help of the exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace of God (though not without it as <hi>Pelugius</hi> ſaid) will its own converſion; and either accept or reject God's grace of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal vocation; and ſo cooperates with the grace of God in the firſt act of converſion. So teacheth the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his book <hi>de gratia &amp; libero Arbitr. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</p>
                     <p>This opinion the Reformed Churches diſrelliſh and reject as diſſenting from holy Scripture, and aſſert the point thus: That the will of man is a meer patient, and not agent at all in the firſt act of converſion; and God's grace is the ſole efficient cauſe thereof; and the will but <hi>ſubjectum recipiens,</hi> the ſubject receiving the grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. But in all other good acts following the firſt, mans will ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170280:93"/>renewed cooperates with the grace of God. And this was the learned S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> his aſſertion, as it's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed (in the 17. <hi>chap.</hi> of his book, <hi>de gratia &amp; libero arbit.)</hi> in theſe words, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t velimus, Deus ſine nobis operatur; quum autem volumus, &amp; ſic volumus ut faciamus, nobiſcum cooperatur.</hi> To will God works without us; but when we do will, and ſo will that we act, God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works with us.</p>
                     <p>That this latter aſſertion is the truth, I ſhall make it appear by theſe three Arguments.</p>
                     <div n="1" type="argument">
                        <head>The firſt Argument.</head>
                        <p>AS is a dead man in his Revivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication or Reſtauration to life, ſo is a natural man to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation or Converſion; which is his Reſtauration to ſpiritual life.</p>
                        <p>But a dead-man can be no cauſe of his own Revivification or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration to life.</p>
                        <p>And therefore a natural man can be no cauſe of his Regeneration, or Reſtauration to ſpiritual life.</p>
                        <p>The aſſumption no man that hath reaſon can deny; for there is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170280:93"/>an impoſſibility that a dead man ſhould cooperate to his own Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vification. The major, or firſt Propoſition is juſtified by thoſe many Texts of Scripture, where it's affirmed of men unregenerate, that they are dead in ſin; as <hi>Luke</hi> 9.60. <hi>Let the dead bury their dead; id eſt,</hi> The dead in ſin, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily dead. And <hi>Luke</hi> 15.24. <hi>This my Son was dead, id eſt,</hi> in ſin. And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> And <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>And you being dead in your ſins, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickned together with him, having forgiven you all treſpaſses.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And this very argument (though not in the ſame words, yet to the ſame purpoſe and effect) <hi>Bellarmine</hi> uſeth againſt the Pelagians in his <hi>Lib.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; cap.</hi> 5. <hi>De gratta &amp; Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bero Arb.</hi> adding only this clauſe to the Aſſumption, <hi>That a dead man neither doth nor can diſpoſe himſelf to life, unleſſe he receives ſome vital power from him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives him;</hi> which (it appears) he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170280:94"/>therefore added, leſt the argument ſhould reflect, and ſo be retorted upon himſelf; who afterwards, in the 10. Chapter of the ſame book, attributes power to mans will to work with God in his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: the will being but firſt aided and excited by the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace of God; by which he means (as it's there very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) a grace preceding the work of converſion. But that the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he there uſeth againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> doth confute himſelf; in that the clauſe which he hath added to the Aſſumption, doth not turn away the edge of the argument from himſelf, I make it plain thus; A dead man can receive no vital power from him that revives him, till he have firſt received ſoul and life, becauſe there can be no vital power but in a living ſubject; it being a proper adjunct of a living ſubject <hi>quarto modo.</hi> If then he muſt receive ſoul and life before he can have any vital power, then cannot his vital power cooperate to his revivification, but muſt of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170280:94"/>neceſſity be a conſequent and an effect of his enlivening. And ſo in like manner the caſe is the ſame with a man ſpiritually dead: He muſt firſt be revived by God before he can have any vital power in him to work with the grace of God; and therefore can be no cauſe at all of his revivification and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in reſpect of the firſt act thereof.</p>

                        <p>IF all the powers of mans ſoul be ſo depraved, that even the chiefeſt of them, namely, his Wiſedom (a power conſiſting both in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and will) be oppoſite to the Will of God, and the Law of God; and ſo oppoſite that it cannot be made conformable and ſubject to the Law of God, while it is the wiſedom of the fleſh; that is, till it be renewed and changed from fleſhly wiſedom to ſpiritual wiſedom; then can there be no power in mans will whereby to co-work with God in the firſt act of his converſion.</p>
                        <p>But all the power and faculties

                        <p>Therefore there can be no power in mans Will to co-work with God in the firſt act of his Converſion.</p>
                        <p>The conſequent in the firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is clear to any intelligent perſon, for if the wiſedom of the fleſh (which leads and guides the Will) cannot conform and be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Law of God, while it is the wiſedom of the fleſh; then cannot the will, which is guided by it, cooperate with the will of God while it is the will of the fleſh; and therefore by undeniable conſequence muſt be renewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can cooperate with his will.</p>
                        <p>And the Aſſumption is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe affirmation of Scripture, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Every imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is only evill continually.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The wiſedom of the fleſh is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170280:95"/>Texts of Scripture, where the co-operation of mans Will with God's Grace in the firſt work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is clearly excluded; and the work attributed to God alone. For brevitie ſake I will quote but ſome of the cleareſt and moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proofs; and omit the reſt, which are very numerous.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>John</hi> 1.13. The Spirit of God ſpeaking there of regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, affirmeth that they are born not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God. In which words the Spirit of God expreſſing a perfect diſtribution of all the powers and forces that are or can be in man, excludes them all from this work, and aſcribes it to the alone will of God; for it neither proceedeth from the bloud of man; that is, from any prerogative of natural propagation or generation, which was wont to be the Phariſees vain brag and oftentation, <hi>We are Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s <hi>peed;</hi> for a which they were ſharply reproved by <hi>John Baptiſt,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170280:96"/>Matth.</hi> 3.9. Nor doth it proceed from the will of the fleſh; that is, from the natural ſtrength of mans corrupt will: nor yet from the will of man; that is, of ſuch a man, whoſe corrupt will is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, bettered and amended, either by the help of the common grace of God, or by the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of humane learning, or by his own wiſe obſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; (for this force the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> carrieth with it, which is here uſed; and ſo in like manner doth the Latine word <hi>uir,</hi> by which it's alſo tranſlated in the Latine) from none of theſe forces in man doth this worke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed (and theſe are all the forces in man's will) but they are all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and God alone is made the Author and Procreant cauſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>A ſecond teſtimony that I ſhall produce for proof of this Truth, is in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8, 9, &amp; 10 <hi>verſes,</hi> where the Apoſtle ſpeaks thus to the <hi>Epheſians; By grace ye are ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170280:96"/>ſelves; it is the gift of God: not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. For we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> In which words the Apoſtle ſtrives to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate our ſelves about this work, and to take away all pretences of our cooperation with God therein. For firſt, He ſaith, It's not of our ſelves; and then he ſaith, It's not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt: but there were matter of boaſting, if our ſelves were co-workers with God herein. And then he addeth (to remove all ſcruple about it) <hi>that we are his workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works.</hi> Where note, that he doth not ſay, his workmanſhip renewed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired (though that be true too) but his workmanſhip created. The Apoſtle (as it may ſeem) did pick out this word on purpoſe (which he again alſo uſeth, ſpeaking of this work in the 4 Chapter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and 24. <hi>v.</hi> his words are, <hi>Put on the new man, which after God is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170280:97"/>created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſs;</hi>) that he might altogether exclude all cooperation herein with God on our part; for to create is the proper act of God; and no creature can have any hand therein.</p>
                        <p>There be many other pregnant and punctual proofs of Scripture for this point: As <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will take away the ſtony heart out of your fleſh, and I will give you a heart of fleſh.</hi> If God make all new, and take away all the old, then is there none of the old left to help to make it ſelf new.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.13. <hi>It's God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> Therefore the Will works not, till God firſt work upon it.</p>
                        <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> If we be not ſufficient of our ſelves to think that which is good; then not to will it, for, <hi>Voluntas ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

                        <p>But to avoid prolixity and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe (which I ever diſliked) I will reſt ſatisfied with the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe few proofs of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which I have already cited, pretermitting a number more of like ſort, as hoping they may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the unprejudiced Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo clear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet done with this Controverſie, but have ſomething more to ſay about it: And that is, to invalidate the main Argument or objection which is brought by them of the Adverſarie part againſt this truth, (for I read of no other of any force) which is this:</p>
                        <p>It's ſaid by them, <hi>That men are called upon in Scripture to turn to God very often; which if they have not power of themſelves to do, the commandment is unjuſt and needleſs;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170280:98"/>for</hi> Nemo tenetur ad impoſſibile.</p>
                        <p>To this I return a five-fold ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or anſwer.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, That though we have no power ſo to do now, as we are fallen in <hi>Adam;</hi> yet did God give us ſo much grace in our firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as would have impowred us hereunto, if we our ſelves had not loſt it: And therefore is it no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity or injuſtice for God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that at our hands, which he once gave us power to do, though now we cannot do it, becauſe we our ſelves have made our ſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do it, and not God.</p>
                        <p>And here I deſire the Reader to take notice, how unfit a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon one of our Adverſaries (in this point) hath uſed; (though cryed up for a man of learning) who chargeth God with as great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, bidding us to turn unto him, if we have not of our ſelves now freedome of will ſo to do, as for a man to cut off another man's legs, and then bid him run; But by his leave (for all his great learning) the caſe is not alike, but varies and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170280:98"/>fails in the main point of all; which is this, In that God gave man legs to run the ways of his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before he bad him run; which he hath cut off himſelf. God gave man power to do all that he requires at his hand, and man hath bereaved himſelf thereof. And therefore it's neither injuſtice nor ſeverity in God to require of man what he once gave him power to do, though now he be unable; becauſe he hath diſabled himſelf. If God had made man unable, the compariſon might have held; but ſeeing man made himſelf unable, the compariſon halteth.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I anſwer, that God's commandments do not alway im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what we can do, but what we ſhould; they do not always argue our ability, but our duty. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample (to inſtance but in one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of many) <hi>We are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love the Lord our God with all the heart, and with all the ſoul, and our neighbours as our ſelves:</hi> This we cannot do in that fulſſe that the Law requires, yet it is not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170280:99"/>ſeverity in God to require it of us, becauſe he once impowred us unto it, namely, in our firſt creation. And the caſe is the ſame about our converſion.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I anſwer, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, though we cannot of our ſelves do it, that we may be put in mind to crave his aid, who only is able to make us to do it. This reaſon is given by S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Jubet Deus quae non poſſumus, ut noverimus quae ab illo petere debemus.</hi> God commands us what we cannot do, to intimate unto us what we ought to crave of him; namely, what we cannot do of our ſelves. And hence are thoſe many prayers of ſeveral ſorts of perſons in the Scripture; as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O Lord, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Convert thou me, and I ſhall be converted.</hi> And <hi>Lament.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Turn thou us unto thee. O Lord, and we ſhall be turned.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Fourthly, I anſwer, that God commands us this, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it of our ſelves, that we
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170280:99"/>may be excited to uſe ſuch means as are by God's ordinance and appointment conducible and avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto, and which we have of our ſelves power to uſe, which are Prayer, the Word and the Sacraments; for his calling to us to repent and return unto him, is a provocation or calling to us, to uſe ſuch means as he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to produce the ſame in us.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly and laſtly, I anſwer, That ſuch commands aim not only at our firſt converſion, but at our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary and ſubſequent returns to God; when after our firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, we prevaricate and digreſs from him; in which ſecondary return mans will cooperates with the grace of God, as formerly hath beeen ſaid. And therefore God's invitation of men to theſe returns, wherein their wills have ſome abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to cooperate with his grace, is not vain or needleſſe, but very efficacious to allure and induce them thereunto.</p>
                        <p>Not to tire the Reader with any further diſpute about this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170280:100"/>I will cloſe it up with the addition of theſe two reaſons to the former Arguments, to induce all perſons to adhere to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as the ſafeſt, which I have here aſſerted, Firſt, becauſe this opinion makes a clearer reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of thoſe Texts of Scripture which hold forth a ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction about this point, then the other doth; for according to the other opinon, they are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled without ſome ſcruple. Secondly, becauſe this opinion aſcribes moſt glory to God, to whom all glory belongs; wherein there is no danger, though men detract from themſelves. For to detract from nature, and give to grace is no danger; but to detract from grace, and give to nature, cannot but be dangerous. This was the ſaying of <hi>Peter Lumbard:</hi> and is of all acknowledged and owned for truth.</p>

                     <head>The fourth Controverſie. About the merit of good works.</head>
                     <p>THe Papiſts opinion about this, and Mr. <hi>Haggar</hi>'s, in affirming good works to be cauſes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation (which both they do and he alſo in the 9. <hi>page</hi> of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named diſcourſe) hath ſo little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth, that it deſerves to be exploded, rather then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: And I have good ground for what I affirm. Firſt, Becauſe it's ſo apparently repugnant to Scripture; as to <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8.9. where it's ſaid, <hi>By grace ye are ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: not of works, leſt any ſhould boaſt.</hi> And <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not by the works of righteouſneſſe which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us.</hi> And whereas to ſalve up the diſcord between <hi>Paul</hi>'s affirmation and theirs, they make a diſtinction of good works; of which ſome (ſay they) go before juſtification, and ſome follow after it: and St.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170280:101"/>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> (they ſay) ſpeaks of thoſe that go before; but they ſpeak of ſuch as follow after; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not contradict him; I have formerly declared (namely in my 4th. <hi>Argument;</hi> about the firſt Controverſie, in <hi>page</hi> the 20.) that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of the ſame good works which they ſpeak of; namely, of good works after juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and regeneration: And therefore they are herein contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictors of holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Another ground for what I affirmed before, is this, Becauſe I never had conference with any Papiſt yet (and I have conferred with many in my time) but they all diſclaimed the merit of their own works, when upon occaſion of diſcourſe I have charged them with this groſſe Tenet.</p>
                     <p>I have yet a third ground for what I ſaid; and that is, becauſe I find <hi>Bellarmine</hi> their Arch cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, after his affirmation of the merit of good works, and that they are true cauſes of ſalvation, and that ſome confidence may be placed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170280:101"/>in them (in his book of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, namely, <hi>Libr.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>de Juſtificat.</hi>) to give men counſel, within ten lines after, <hi>to put no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in their merits, but in the alone mercy and benignity of God, as the ſafeſt way.</hi> So that there is no great neceſſity to confute this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the merit of works, ſeeing themſelves do diſtruſt it, and after a ſort deſert it.</p>
                     <p>But yet ſome ſhort confutation of this palpable error I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver; which (I hope) ſhall ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently convince it: And the firſt Argument I frame thus.</p>

                        <p>IF there be no analogy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between eternal life and our good works, then cannot our good works merit eternal life. This conſequence is a clear truth in reaſon; for a reward is to be adequated and proportioned unto the work.</p>
                        <p>But there is no analogy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between eternal life and
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170280:103"/>good works; for the reward of eternal life is infinite, but man's good works are finite; and <hi>(finiti ad infinitum nulla eſt proportio)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a finite thing and an infinite there is no proportion. Therefore the Concluſion holds, That eternal life cannot be merited by mens good works.</p>
                        <p>I will anſwer the main Argument for the merit of works, &amp; ſo I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning this Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>It's alledged for defence of the merit of works, That the Scripture affirms that they ſhall be rewarded with eternal life, and that very often, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Bleſſed are ye when men ſhall revile you and perſecute you, &amp;c. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, Luke</hi> 14.14. <hi>When thou makeſt a feaſt, call the poor, &amp;c. and thou ſhalt be recompenſed at the reſurrection of the juſt. Heb.</hi> 11.26. <hi>It's ſaid, That</hi> Moſes <hi>eſteemed the rebuke of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures of</hi> Egypt, <hi>becaus behad reſpect unto the recompence of reward.</hi> And oft elſewhere eternal life is called
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170280:104"/>a reward, which (ſay the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries) imports the merit of good works, becauſe <hi>(merces &amp; meritum)</hi> reward and merit are relatives.</p>
                        <p>To this I anſwer, That there is a double reward: 1. A reward of merit or debt; and 2. A reward of mercy or favour. And this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is not deviſed or coyned by man's wit, nor hewen out of the quarry of his brain; but is framed by the holy Ghoſt himſelf, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.4. where it's thus written, <hi>Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of grace, but of debt;</hi> where he bath made an apparent diſtribution of reward in theſe two ſorts. 1. A reward of grace: and 2. A reward of debt. Now eternal life is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of grace, mercy, or favour; and not a reward of debt or merit, as the Texts before quoted demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; <hi>ſcil. Luke</hi> 12.32. <hi>John</hi> 10 28. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. In all which places it's called <hi>the gift of God:</hi> and a gift proceeding from his own pleaſure, and therefore can be no debt that God oweth to men for their good works; for a gift and debt are ſo
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170280:104"/>diſſentaneous, that they cannot conſiſt together, nor be predicated of one and the ſame ſubject.</p>
                        <p>And hence it is, that though God hath oft promiſed to reward ſuch as do good works with everlaſting life, (that he may provoke all men unto them) yet it is nowhere ſaid, that they ſhall be rewarded for them, (for that might have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted to have intimated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ſome merit in them) but the Scripture in mentioning God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of good works, uſeth this phraſe, That <hi>they ſhall be rewarded according to their works;</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates the reward to be given of God's mercy, and not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by man's merits. Thus it's expreſſed <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62.12. <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy; for thou ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt to every man according to his works. Matth.</hi> 16.27. <hi>The Son of man ſhall come in the glory of the Father with his Angels; and then he ſhall reward every man according to his works.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt all appear before the tribunal ſeat of Chriſt, that every man may receive
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170280:105"/>according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad. Rev.</hi> 20.12. &amp; 13. <hi>verſes:</hi> It's twice ſaid of the dead, that they were judged ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works; and in Chapter the 22 and verſe the 12. <hi>Beheld,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work ſhall be.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is the conſtant expreſſion of Scripture in ſpeaking of the reward of good works, to phraſe it (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to works) and no where (for them) leſt men ſhould preſume to aſcribe ſome merit unto them.</p>
                        <p>And this makes it evident, that the Popiſh diſtinction of the merit of condignity, and the merit of congruity, is but a meer gingle and ſhift to evade the force of the former Arguments againſt the merit of good works; for the merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity (which they attribute to good works) proceeds from mercy (as they confeſſe themſelves) and therefore cannot properly be called merit; for mercy and merit are contradiſtinct and inconſiſtent, it's
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170280:105"/>the very affirmation of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. <hi>If by grace, then it's no more of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace: but if it be of works, then is it no more grace; otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> Here the Apoſtle makes a flat oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween grace and works; and there is the very ſame oppoſition between mercy and merit; which hath forced that confeſſion from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> (which hath oft dropped from his pen in his book of Controverſies) <hi>Merita noſtra ſunt Dei munera.</hi> The like was S. <hi>Bernard</hi> his confeſſion to Almighty God; <hi>Meritum meum eſt miſericordia tua, my merit is thy mercy.</hi> Both which are agreeable to the ſentence of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Book of Homiles, (in Homil. the 14) <hi>Quum bona <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>From this premiſed diſcourſe I deduct this corolary or capitulation of the cauſes of ſalvation, as they are in order manifeſted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:170280:106"/>
                        <p>Firſt, God's free grace and love is the primary and principal effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe of election unto ſalvation. This is juſtified by theſe Texts, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide many other) <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. <hi>Even ſo then at this preſent time alſo, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> And again in the 11. verſe following of the ſame Chapter; <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an inheritance, being prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated according to the purpoſe of him who worketh all things after the counſell of his own will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, Chriſt's obedience, active and paſſive, is the meritorious cauſe of ſalvation, and of all the means conducting thereunto. So <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.14. <hi>We have redemption through his bloud, even the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> And 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. <hi>The bloud of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. <hi>Knowing that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170280:106"/>gold, from your vain converſation received by tradition from your fathers; but with the precious bloud of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot;</hi> with many ſuch like Texts.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Faith is the inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal cauſe, that is to ſay, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereby we receive Chriſt, and apply his merits to us; ſo <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>As many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> And <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. The Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt dwells in our hearts by faith.</hi> And hence it is our righteouſneſſe is called, both <hi>the righteouſneſs of faith, Rom.</hi> 10.6. And <hi>the righteouſneſſe, which is by faith, Heb.</hi> 11.7. And <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which is of God by faith, Phil.</hi> 3.9.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Vocation, and Juſtification, and Sanctification, and good works, and eternal life and ſalvation, are the joynt fruits and effects of the aforenamed cauſes, ſucceſſively following one another. Vocacion, Juſtification, and Sanctification, and good works
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170280:107"/>are the firſt fruits and effects of the foreſaid cauſes brought forth here in this life, as numerous Texts of Scripture teſtifie, which I need not recite, becauſe they are familiarly known, and becauſe I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned divers of them formerly. And Eternal Life and Salvation is the laſt fruit, the conſummation and ultimate end of all, as it's very often taught and teſtified. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. <hi>Being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God, ye have your fruit unto helineſs, and the end everlaſting life.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Receiving the end of your faith, even the ſalvation of your ſouls.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe are the links of the golden chain of ſalvation, and the order of the cauſes thereof; as they are annexed and held forth to us in the word of God. And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. they are ſummed up together, though in fewer words: <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:170280:107"/>
                        <p>And hence is Mr. <hi>Haggar</hi>'s groſſe error, in his concatenation of the cauſes of ſalvation, detected and confuted; In that he makes ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and good works cauſes of ſalvation; which are but fruits and effects of God's election, and the merits of Chriſt apprehended by faith, for they go before ſalvation only as neceſſary antecedents, and as the appointed way to lead us to ſalvation, and as preparatives for Heaven; (as hath been already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) but not as cauſes thereof. 1. They are, <hi>Via regn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So ſanctification and good works, though they be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry antecedents to ſalvation, ſo that we cannot paſſe to Heaven, but through them; yet they are not the cauſes which brings us thither; but the cauſes thereof are the mercies of God, and the merits of Chriſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170280:108"/>apprehended by Faith. And ſo I end this Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>If now I have not untied the Gordian knots of theſe long deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Controverſies, ſo fully and openly as to give ſatisfaction to all whoſe thoughts have been formerly puzzled about them (as I believe I ſhall not) yet my labour will not be wholly loſt in theſe regards: Firſt, Becauſe I have hereby decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my willingneſſe to do the Church ſervice to my power, by putting my hand to the ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truth of the goſpel; which theſe ſtormy times have ſo impetuouſly and vehemently ſhaken.

                        <head>The ſecond Point opened; what origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin is.</head>
                        <p>ORiginal ſin is a pravity, vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, or vitious habit, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diſpoſition of man's nature from his firſt conception; as a juſt puniſhment of all mens ſin in <hi>Adam;</hi> whereby they are born the children of wrath, and become ſubject to death both of body and ſoul; and alſo become prone to commit all actual ſins. <hi>Or thus,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Original ſin is a pravity of man's nature from his firſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereby he ſeems to be prone to all ſin; as a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin or tranſgreſſion, whereof all men are guilty; and for which all men are expoſed and ſubjected to death both corporal and eternal.</p>
                        <p>Both theſe definitions have one and the ſame ſenſe. And from them ye may obſerve that there be three things in Original Sin, or three
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170280:110"/>parts of it. The firſt is the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, whereof S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. where he ſaith, <hi>By one man's diſobedience many were made ſinners.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, There is the defect and want of original righteouſneſſe; whereof he ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God; i.e.</hi> of God's image, which was in man's firſt creation ſtamped upon him. And for this expoſition I have warrant from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. in that the Apoſtle there joyned theſe together as ſynonimas, image and glory, when he ſaith, <hi>That man is the image and glory of God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, There is the ſucceſſion of a vitious habit and corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in man's nature in place of his primitive righteouſneſſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we read <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. where God himſelf witneſſeth, <hi>That the whole imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evill continually.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2, &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>And here I deſire the Reader to conſider how theſe three parts of this our native ſin do produce and bring forth one another; the firſt, namely the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, being the ſole cauſe of the other two; as theſe Texts (beſide many other) declare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. <hi>All have ſinned</hi> (that is, in <hi>Adam) and come ſhort of the glory of God; i.e.</hi> come ſhort of that glorious image of God, by reaſon of that ſin of <hi>Adam</hi>'s, whereof all are guilty. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By one man's diſobedience many wert made ſinners.</hi> By which one man, <hi>Adam</hi> is underſtood (as all acknowledge.) And ſo theſe two Texts make it clear, that childrens want of Original or Primitive righteouſneſſe, and the inquination and depravation of their natures, do both flow from their guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin, and are the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents of it.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The interrogations in both theſe Texts imply an impoſſibility that any woman ſhould bring forth a child free from the pollution and tincture of ſin in the ordinary way of conception and parturition.</p>

                        <p>The Anabaptiſts (to avoid the repugnancy between their Tenet and this Text) have deviſed this ſhift.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170280:112"/>man (that ſeeks the truth) ſhould bluſh to own it; for this is one of <hi>David</hi>'s penitential Pſalms, wherein he makes humble confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his own ſins to God, and not of his mother's; and makes earneſt requeſt and ſupplication for the expiation of them, as all the precedent verſes declare. And again, though the latter words in the verſe might be wreſted to be ſpoken of his mother's ſin, as well as his own, becauſe mention is made of her, yet the firſt words which are theſe, <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be underſtood of himſelf, and can have no reference to his mother, without violence to the Text, and wilful wreſting of it.</p>

                           <p>IF children be not conceived and born in ſin, then is there no need of their regeneration or ſecond birth to their ſalvation, before they have made themſelves ſinners by actual tranſgreſſion; for nothing hinders from ſalvation but ſin.</p>
                           <p>But children have need of a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or ſecond birth to their ſalvation, before they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any actual ſin; as is clear from our Saviour's words, twice affirmed with vehement aſſeveration <hi>John</hi> 3.3. &amp; 5. <hi>verſes, Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> And this is ſpoken without any exception of Infants, either there or in any other place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and is alſo proved by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the verſe next following to concern Infants, as well as men of years; becauſe <hi>whatſoever is born of the fleſh</hi> (that is, of fleſhly and ſinful
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170280:113"/>Parents) <hi>is fleſh,</hi> that is, is fleſhly and finful; for ſo we find in other places of Scripture, (as was ſaid before) that where the fleſh and ſpirit are oppoſed one to another, (as they are in this verſe) there by ſpirit is underſtood the regenerate part in man, and by fleſh the unregenerate part, as (beſide the former Text quoted, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16, &amp; 17. verſes) is to be ſeen in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſeveral times; verſe the 5. <hi>They that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh; but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</hi> And in the next verſe, <hi>To be carnally minded is death, but to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.</hi> And in the 9. verſe, <hi>Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit.</hi> And again in the 13. verſe, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> In all which places (as alſo in moſt other in the New Teſtament where the Spirit and the fleſh are ſet in oppoſition one to another) there by fleſh is meant the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part in man; unleſs ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170280:114"/>in the context do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily require that ſuch places ſhould be otherwiſe underſtood.

                           <p>THey that are ſubject to diſeaſes and death in their conception and birth, are in their conception and birth ſinful; for theſe, namely, diſeaſes and death, are affirmed to be the fruits and effects of ſin in Scripture very frequently; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the World, and death by ſin;</hi> and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> So that where we ſee death or ſickneſſe ſieze upon any young or old, there we may ſurely conclude, that ſin hath gone before: But Infants are ſubject to diſeaſes and death in their very conception and birth. Therefore they are in their conception and birth ſinful. To evade the force of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Yet leſt he ſhould ſeem to contradict Scripture (which every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where affirms all ſin to provoke God's anger, and to deſerve death, and to bring forth fruit unto death) he confeſſeth, that any ſin deſerves death, but not every kind of death. His words are theſe, I grant (ſaith he) that the wages of ſin is death, but the wages of any ſin is not every kind of death. And ſo denies that <hi>Adam</hi> incurred any other death by his ſin then the death of the body.</p>
                           <p>Touching this anſwer and this expoſition of the foreſaid Texts of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170280:115"/>Scripture; I deſire the Reader to take notice of theſe two failings and falts therein. Firſt, it extenuates the hainouſneſs of ſin, and minceth and diminiſheth that juſt demerit and penalty of it, which throughout the whole Scripture is denounced againſt it; which is death both of body and ſoul. Secondly, It's a conceſſion and confeſſion in effect, that children are by nature ſinful, born with fin upon them, and in them; for if the wages of any be death (which is truth, and he ingeniouſly affirms it) then where there is any death, there muſt needs be ſome ſin; or elſe the wages and penalty of ſin ſhould be inflicted where there is no ſin.</p>
                           <p>Whereas therefore ſome children ſuffer in their infancy ſome kind of death, namely bodily death; they muſt needs be guilty of ſome kind of ſin, otherwiſe they ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with bodily death undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly (which to affirm were blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy) But they can have no actual ſin (as is confeſſed of all men) and therefore the ſin which
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170280:115"/>expoſeth them to death muſt needs be ſome latent ſin, wherewith their natures are ſtained from the womb (as the Scripture ſpeakes) which is that which we call originall. And ſo ye may ſee that his anſwer to the argument is in effect a conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the unaſwerable force of it, and of that which he would ſeeme to deny. But I will diſplay Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> his groſs errour about this point yet a little further.</p>
                           <p>He confeſſeth in the ſame place of his book, <hi>that actuall ſins in men deſerve eternall death, though not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin all ſin.</hi> Now I would know of him, whether <hi>Adam's</hi> firſt ſin was not actuall ſin. This I am ſure he cannot deny; Nay a very hainous actuall ſin it was, as might be laid open by many circumſtances. This then being granted; I demand of him, why actuall ſins in us ſhould be puniſhable with eternall death, and not this firſt hainous actuall ſin of <hi>Adam</hi>'s? I dare anſwer for him, that he cannot tel. For if our actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſins deſerve eternall death, much rather that of <hi>Adam's,</hi> as who had
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170280:116"/>greater light, and more grace, and leſs temptations then we have. All which conſiderations are ſo many aggravations of his ſin.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, to trample this vile errour yet once more under foot, that it may never lift up it ſelfe againe, I demand of theſe Anabaptiſts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> did not by his ſin diveſt and diſrobe himſelfe of that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous image of God after which he was made; which conſiſted eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>in righteouſneſse and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> as the Apoſtle hath declared <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22.23. <hi>and</hi> 24.<hi>verſes;</hi> for there he exhorts to <hi>put of the old man;</hi> by which he means the vitioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; ſinfulneſs of our natures, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and propagated into us by old <hi>Adam:</hi> and then to <hi>be renewed in the ſpirit of our minds, and to put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> which implyes, that Gods i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, after which man was firſt created, did conſiſt in righteouſneſs and holineſs.</p>
                           <p>Now if they deny, that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin deprived himſelfe of God's
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170280:116"/>image, conſiſting in righteouſneſs and holineſs; they muſt deny the 5. chapter of <hi>Pauls</hi> epiſtle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> to be Canonicall Scripture, for there the Apoſtle affirmes ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times in the five laſt verſes that by Chriſt we regain both righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and life; which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt. And againe the word (<hi>renewed</hi> which the Scripture uſeth in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereof) implyes a deprivation of that which was before: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can properly be ſaid to be renewed, but where there hath been a precedent deprivation of that which is renewed.</p>
                           <p>Again on the other ſide; if they confeſs that <hi>Adam</hi> by his ſin depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelfe of God's image, then they confeſs (by conſeqvence) that his ſin brought upon him ſpirituall death; (which is a further penalty then corporall death, and ſo impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their tenet, that <hi>Adam</hi> incurred by his firſt ſin no other death, then the death of the body) for as the ſoule gives naturall life to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo the image of God, namely righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, gives
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170280:117"/>ſpirituall life to the ſoule; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the ſoul is ſpiritually dead, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. &amp; <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.13. and divers other Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture witneſſe, where mention is made of a death in ſin: <hi>You that were dead in your ſins and the uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickened, &amp;c.</hi> whence by undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequence it follows, that where there is a deprivation of the ſpiritual life of righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, there muſt needs follow a ſpiritual death in ſin. Now if they deny grace, righteouſneſſe and holineſſe to be the life of the ſoul, I refer them to the view of theſe three Texts of Scripture (omitting many other) where it's expreſlly aſſerted, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.21, 22. <hi>Keep ſound wiſedom and diſcretion, ſo ſhall they be life unto thy ſoul.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>To be carnally minded is death; but to be ſpiritually minded is life.</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. <hi>The ſpirit is life, becauſe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs:</hi> that is, The ſoul is alive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, becauſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>

                           <p>THey whom Chriſt came to ſave are ſinners: So ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave ſinners.</hi> And this muſt needs be ſo in reaſon; for where there is no ſin, there is no need of a Saviour. But Chriſt came to ſave Infants as well as men of years.</p>
                           <p>Therefore they are ſinners.</p>
                           <p>Now that Chriſt came to ſave Infants as well as men of years, appears by Scripture theſe two ways. 1. Becauſe he died for all men, as oft the Scripture affirms; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſome for all. Heb.</hi> 2.9. <hi>He taſted death for every man.</hi> For whether (all) in theſe and the like Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be taken for all ſorts of men only, or for all of all ſorts, Infants muſt needs be included amongſt them, for they are one ſort of men. 2. Becauſe he invited children to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170280:118"/>come unto him, or to be brought unto him, as is ſaid, <hi>Marke</hi> 10.14. which intimates, that he came into the world to ſave them, as well as men of years.</p>
                           <p>I will add one argument more for proof of this point; to which the wit of man (though prompted by the cunning ſuggeſtion of the old ſerpent) cannot deviſe a ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory anſwer.</p>
                        </div>

                              <hi>Argument</hi> 4.</head>
                           <p>THey which are by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, are by nature ſinners.</p>
                           <p>But all men are by nature chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                           <p>Therefore all men are by nature ſinners; and ſo conſequently Infants.</p>
                           <p>The firſt propoſition is all that I have to prove; (for the aſſumption is S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s own affirmation) And I find it the conſtant doctrine of holy Scripture, both in the Old and New Teſtament, which evermore teacheth ſin to be the only cauſe of God's anger and wrath; And this in reaſon muſt needs be ſo, becauſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170280:118"/>all things elſe were his own works; which were all good, yea, <hi>very good,</hi> (as we read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.) And ſin only was the Divel's work, the enemy of God and all goodneſſe; and therefore ſin only is ſaid to provoke God's anger, and wrath. The teſtimonies of Scripture are ſo numerous for this, that I will name but this one of a thomſand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſſe of men.</hi> And how oft God is ſaid in Scripture to have been provoked to anger by the ſins of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> none can be ignorant.</p>
                           <p>I will add but one thing more about this argument, and ſo I will conclude it.</p>
                           <p>The forenamed Text in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. with what is deducible from it (where it is affirmed, that <hi>we are all by nature the children of wrath</hi>) puzleth the Anabaptiſts not a little, and puts them to their ſhifts to frame ſuch an expoſition thereof as may not impugn their own falſe Tenet about original ſin. This
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170280:119"/>may appear from that expoſition, which the forementioned Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> hath made of that Text, in the 6. page of his book that I named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, where he thus expounds it: By nature (ſaith he) is underſtood, firſt the matter and form of our bodies, which are good; and principally the light that God hath placed in man.</p>
                           <p>Now that this is a novel, falſe, and irrational interpretation of this Text, I thus diſcover. If by nature here be underſtood nothing but what is good: namely, the matter and form of our bodies, and the light that God hath placed in us; then how can it make us the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of wrath, as here it's ſaid of it? for nothing that's good can make us children of wrath. It's ſin only, (which was firſt brought forth by Satan) and nothing elſe, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God's wrath, as formerly was proved. By nature therefore in this place, of neceſſity muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſomething that is ſinful (for elſe it could not make us children of wrath, as hath been ſhewed)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170280:119"/>which can be nothing elſe but that vitioſity, pravity and corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which from our firſt birth and being is propagated into our bodies and ſouls by natural gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                           <p>For though it were granted, that by (nature) here be meant the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our ſouls and bodies; yet of neceſſity it muſt be alſo granted (as hath been now proved) that it's meant of them, not as pure and free from any ſin; but as vitiated and depraved therewith from their firſt union and conjunction toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into one individual.</p>
                           <p>It remains therefore a ſure and ſacred truth, inviolable and infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible; and not to be contradicted, but by obſtinacy or impudence it ſelf, That children are born in ſin.</p>

                     <head>The ſixth Controverſie. About Tithes.</head>
                     <p>THere is an obſteperous clamour raiſed againſt Tithes by the Anabaptiſtical teachers, who yet (for the moſt part) lay as heavy a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170280:120"/>burthen upon their diſciples, and put them to as great coſt and charges as is equivalent to Tithes: And this (in all probability) they have broached and ventilated to get the better morſel for themſelves. For this they find by experience, that the way to inſinuate with the common people, and to winde themſelves into their boſomes, is to preach pleaſing things unto them; and eſpecially ſuch as ſound for their profit, be it right or wrong.</p>
                     <p>To ſtop their mouths, (if it may be) if not, yet to juſtifie the practiſe of paying and receiving Tithes. I will firſt make it appear, that it ſtands with equity and juſtice, that Miniſters of the Goſpel have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and recompence for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their work of the Miniſtery; and ſuch an allowance as may afford them a competent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable livelihood and ſubſiſtence.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I ſhall make it appear, That it ſtands with equity and juſtice, that they have Tithes for their allowance.</p>

                        <head>1.</head>
                        <p>The former I ſhall prove both by Scripture and force of reaſon.</p>
                        <p>By Scripture I ſhall prove it both in the Old Teſtament and in the New.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, In the Old Teſtament: God commanded that the Levites, who were the perſons ſet apart to attend upon the ſervice of God in thoſe times under the Law, as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word are under the Goſpel, ſhould have allowance both by Tithes, and other emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and profits out of ſacrifices and oblations; (as every one knows) and moreover they had given them by God's appointment 48. Cities with their ſuburbs, and land annexed and appropriated to every one of them, extending in quantity to 2000. Cubits of ground round about every City; as it's recorded in the 25th. Chapter of the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> and the firſt verſe, and ſo forward.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, In the new Teſtament, our Saviour Chriſt ſending forth his 70. diſciples to preach the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170280:121"/>Goſpel, bids them take neither bag, nor ſcrip, nor ſhooes, but to eat and drink with thoſe into whoſe houſes they entred; <hi>for the labourer is worthy of his hire, Luke</hi> 10.4, 5, 6, &amp; 7. verſes. S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo juſtifies this at large, and ſeveral times in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.9, 10, &amp; 11. verſes, He writes thus, <hi>It is written in the Law of</hi> Moſes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for Oxen? or ſaith he it altogether for our ſakes? for our ſakes, no doubt this is written; that he that ploweth, ſhould plow in hope; and that he that threſheth in hope, ſhould be partaker of his hope. If we have ſowen unto you ſpiritual things, is it a great thing if we ſhall reap your carnal things?</hi> And then he addeth in the 23. verſe, <hi>Do you not know that they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? even ſo hath the Lord ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they which preach the Goſpell, ſhould live of the Goſpell.</hi> Here is no ambiguity nor obſcurity in this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170280:121"/>Text, but a plain and punctual affirmation, that they which preach the Goſpel ſhould have their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and livelihood for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. But ſee yet further proof hereof (to beat down (if it may) that unreaſonable and unjuſt deſire that is in ſome niggardly people, who would have Miniſters do all their work and labour for nothing) <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. The Apoſtle gives this precept, <hi>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate to him that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, in all good things.</hi> And again, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17, 18. verſes, <hi>Let the elders which rule well, be counted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of double honour; eſpecially they who labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> For the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the Oxe that treadeth out the corn; and the labourer is worthy of his reward.</hi> Here then is plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proof of Scripture for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of this point.</p>
                        <p>But now ſee it proved alſo by force of reaſon, which I have learned out of Scripture alſo; namely out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7, 8, 12. here the Apoſtle reaſons after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170280:122"/>
                           <hi>Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock? Say I theſe things as a man? or ſaith not the Law the ſame alſo?</hi> And then in the verſes following (rehearſed before) applies it to the Miniſters of the Goſpel. As if he ſhould have ſaid, Every vocation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, from the higheſt to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, from the King to the day-labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, affords ſome emolument and recompence to them that labour in them; this cannot be denied. And therefore, if all other men live by their functions and callings; it's juſt that Miniſters alſo ſhould alſo live by theirs.</p>
                        <p>Again, I read in Scripture; namely, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.2. That <hi>a Biſhop ſhould be hoſpitable.</hi> Now if people ſhould afford him no allowance and compenſation for his labour and pains, but rather ſubduct that which hath been formerly given both by God (as I ſhall make appear hereafter) and devout men, to the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170280:122"/>ſupport of the Miniſtry; I demand, (which I know cannot be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwered) by what means a Biſhop ſhould maintain hoſpitalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? So that very reaſon, equity and juſtice, claim an allowance to be yielded to the maintenance of the Miniſtry.</p>

                        <p>And this I prove four ways, or by four Arguments.</p>

                           <p>Secondly, Becauſe the payment of Tithes hath been uſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued here in <hi>England</hi> many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170280:123"/>years, by the appointment of the ſupreame Magiſtrates from time to time without any interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and hath been alſo confirmed and eſtabliſhed by ſundry laws under the Saxon Kings of this Realm long before the Conqueſt; and by many Acts of Parliament ſince in their ſeveral Ages, which never yet were repealed: Who herein have followed the pattern which God had ſet them; ſo that to charge them with injuſtice herein, is both againſt Reaſon, Religion, Duty and charity. From whence it's clear, that Beneficed Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in their ſeveral reſpective Incumbencies, have as full, juſt, and legal title and claim to their Tithes, and as much right thereunto, as any Lord of a Mannour, Freeholder, or other perſon hath to any of the Lands or Goods whereof he ſtandeth poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; to wit, <hi>Per Leges &amp; Conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines Angliae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherefore ſeeing it's evident out of the Chronicles and Hiſtories of the Politick Government of this
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170280:123"/>Nation, that Tithes have been ſo long alienated from the Layity, and dedicated and given to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Miniſtry, by thoſe perſons in ſupreme power, from whom Lay-mens title to their Lands, and to the other nine parts of the increaſe and fruits of the ſame was derived; it's therefore contrary to all equity and reaſon, that they ſhould claim any property or intereſt in Tithes now, who have been ſo long time out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of them, and diveſted of all intereſt and property in them.</p>
                        </div>

                              <hi>Argument</hi> 3.</head>
                           <p>Thirdly, Becauſe Tithes are aſſigned to the Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> by the peoples own conſent and Vote in Parliament: For the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Vote is their Vote, the Parliament being the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body of all the people in the Land.</p>
                           <p>Furthermore it's alſo to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, for the defence of the juſtice of the peoples payment of Tithes to Miniſters; that ſeeing it's not nominated in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170280:124"/>(where a compenſation is allowed and enjoyned for the work of the Miniſtry) what or how much this compenſation or allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſhall be, therefore there was great equity that the ſupreme law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Magiſtrate, and the Parliament ſhould determine and appoint what it ſhould be, as being the fitteſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Judges between the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and the People: For it was neither fit that Miniſters ſhould have what they would demand, for then (it's probable) ſome would have too much, nor yet that people ſhould give them but what they pleaſed, for then (it's more then probable) they would give too little.</p>
                           <p>It remains therefore that the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes to Miniſters (as the caſe ſtands here in <hi>England</hi>) is both equal and juſt; as being juſtified both by the Law of God and man, and by the peoples own aſſent and Vote in Parliament. And that therefore all Oppoſers of the ſame, are by neceſſary conſequence Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers both of the Law of God and the lawful Magiſtrate, and their own Vote.</p>

                              <hi>Argument</hi> 4.</head>
                           <p>I come now to a fourth and laſt argument for proofe of this point of the Clergies juſt title to Tithes; which (though it will be moſt cavilled at by Gainſayers, yet) to ſuch as are truly religious, and not poſſeſt with prejudice, it will be of very great force to bend and bind their conſciences to a free and a full acknowledgement of this truth.</p>
                           <p>I find in Scripture, by comparing one Text with another, that God himſelf, in his firſt general Grant to <hi>Adam</hi> and his poſterity, of a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over, and a free uſe of theſe inferiour creatures (mentioned <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. did reſerve a Tenth out of the fruits of the land to himſelf, which afterwards (namely when he had inſtituted a Miniſterial and Sacerdotal function, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the publique duties of his own worſhip and ſervice) he gave to thoſe that did officiate therein. And therefore to that Function they belong ſtill, and are not alienable from it by any
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170280:125"/>power on Earth, becauſe annexed, appended and appropriated to it by a Divine Donation.</p>
                           <p>To make good this Argument, I have two things to prove. Firſt, that God reſerved to himſelf a Tenth out of the increaſe and fruits of the Earth, when he conferred upon <hi>Adam</hi> a power and property over theſe things below. Secondly, that he aſſigned and gave the ſame Tenth to the Prieſthood, for the ſupport of his own Worſhip and Service.</p>
                           <p>For proof of the former, I bring theſe three Texts of Scripture. The firſt is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.21, 22. Where I find the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> vowing theſe two duties to God. 1. His faith and affiance in God, in theſe words, <hi>Then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> 2. His payment of Tithe to God, in theſe words; <hi>and I will ſurely give the tenth unto thee.</hi> By which latter ſpeech it appears, that the Tenth of his increaſe was due to God. For if it be objected, that the payment of the Tenth to God might be a voluntary oblation, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170280:125"/>not a due or duty formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God. To this I anſwer, that the former branch of his vow being a neceſſary duty which he did owe unto God; it's very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that this latter branch (which is coupled with it) ſhould be a voluntary oblation; but moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that it was a duty of right appertaining to God as well as the other.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond proof of Scripture which I produce is in <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.30. Where the Lord himſelf ſpeaks thus to <hi>Moſes; All the Tithe of the land, whether of the ſeed of the land, or the fruit of the tree, it is the Lord's, it is holy unto the Lord.</hi> Here we have a ſpecial and peculiar appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of Tithes to Almighty God ſignified from his own mouth.</p>
                           <p>The third proof is in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. where God again ſpeaks after this manner; <hi>Will a man rob God? yet ye have robbed me; but ye ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have we robbed thee? in tithes and offerings.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This appropriation of Tithes to God in both theſe latter Texts,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170280:126"/>argues undeniably a more ſpecial and peculiar right and property in them, then appertains to him by his general right of creation, which (in all probability) was a reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to himſelf; when he granted to man a Lordſhip and property in and over theſe ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and inferiour creatures. And theſe he reſerved (as appeared by his diſpoſal of them afterward) for the maintenance and ſupport of his own ſolemn worſhip and ſervice, as fore-ſeeing how penurious, tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſtrait-handed people would be in contributing to the ſupport and furtherance of the ſame.</p>
                           <p>And that this is ſo, may more clearly appear theſe two ways, or by theſe two conſiderations. Firſt, Becauſe this claim was made by God, before his inſtitution of the Levitical function, to which he gave the Tithes afterwards; ſo that God could not then claim them in any reference to the Levites (as otherwiſe might have been ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) becauſe they were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170280:126"/>to their Sacerdotal office till afterwards, as is manifeſted by the ſtory following in the firſt and third Chapters of the book of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> where their firſt inſtitution is recorded.</p>

                        <p>Secondly, Becauſe God could not have claimed them as his own in this diſtinct way and ſenſe from the reſt, if he had given them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to <hi>Adam:</hi> And therefore this peculiar claim and property, which God challengeth to Tithes (which is in effect a denial of them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to man) ſpeaketh his reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them to himſelf, when he firſt paſſed his original grant of all things here below to <hi>Adam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, I have yet to prove that God gave theſe Tithes (which he had reſerved to himſelf) to the Prieſts and Levites. And this I prove by three Texts of Scripture.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, I read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18.19, &amp; 20. verſes, <hi>That when</hi> Melchi-zedek <hi>the Prieſt of the moſt high God, had bleſſed the Patriarch Abraham, he gave him Tithes of all;</hi> that is, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                           <pb n="96" facs="tcp:170280:127"/>gave <hi>Melchi-zedek</hi> the Prieſt the tenth of the ſpoyls that he had gotten in a battel, as it's expreſſed <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.4. This we may not imagine to be done by <hi>Abraham</hi> without ſpecial warrant from God (though the Scripture makes no mention thereof) as who is ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in Scripture for his faith and upright walking with God.</p>
                        <p>And by this fact it appears, that God appointed Tithes to be given to his Prieſts; this being the firſt mention that is made of them in Scripture. Secondly, It's clearly proved by a manifeſt of God's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Tithes to the Levites, in <hi>Numb.</hi> 18 21, 24, 25, &amp; 26. verſes, where the Lord tells <hi>Aaron</hi> three ſeveral times, <hi>that he had given the tithe of the children of Iſrael to the Levites.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It's affirmed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.5. where we find it thus written; <hi>And verily they that are of the ſons of Levi, who receive the office of the Prieſt-hood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170280:127"/>
                        <p>Now from the premiſes I collect, that Tithes are due to God's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters by divine right; as who have a juſt title unto them by a ſpecial donation and grant from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to whom they primitively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed, as hath been demonſtrated. And that therefore to alienate them from the Miniſtry, and to put them into the hands of the Laity, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and manifeſt ſacriledge.</p>
                        <p>I will make a ſhort anſwer to the ridiculous objections of ſome irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, unjuſt and covetous people againſt the payment of Tithes, and ſo conclude.</p>

                              <p>To this I anſwer, 1. That our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpake theſe words to his twelve Apoſtles, to whom he gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and command to go and preach the Goſpel to all the world, as it's recorded <hi>Marke</hi> 16.15. So
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170280:128"/>that they could have no leaſure to ſtay in any one place ſo long as to gather Tithes, having ſo great a journey to travel.</p>

                              <p>Secondly, I anſwer, That he bade them not only to preach, <hi>but to heal the ſick, raiſe the dead, and caſt out divels;</hi> and then ſaid, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give:</hi> becauſe to do ſuch miraculous works, as to <hi>heal their ſick,</hi> and <hi>caſt out divels,</hi> and <hi>raiſe their dead,</hi> he knew that the people would be haſty to give large moneys; and therefore he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to do ſuch miracles freely, leſt through avarice they ſhould abuſe his free grace to their own private gain. And that he meant not to forbid them to take any reward for preaching (though they took nothing for working miracles) is apparent from the two next verſes following, where he ſubjoyns theſe ſpeeches; <hi>Provide neither gold nor ſilver, nor braſs in your purſes, nor ſcrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither ſhooes, nor yet ſtaves; for the workman is worthy

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170280:129"/>againe they may preach for money; that is, as deſerving and expecting money, as a due reward of their pains, and the means of their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and ſubſiſtence.</p>
